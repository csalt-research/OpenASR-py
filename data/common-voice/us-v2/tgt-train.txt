let's do this in chronological order
his girlfriend always has cold feet in the morning
i took a number and found my seat
you can choose either yes or nope
forty two is not a random number
a sullen smile gets few friends
my palms were sweaty and my mouth was dry it must be a phobia
he takes the oath of office each march
the glow deepened in the eyes of the sweet girl
at the camp it was difficult to see anything
am i going to find my treasure he asked
the boy was becoming nervous
the camel drivers exchanged information about windstorms and told stories about the desert
the boy looked around him at the date palms
he was more certain of it than of anything in the world
his heart was heavy and he had been melancholy since the previous night
i saw astonishment and horror on the faces of the people around me
i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
without such love one's dreams would have no meaning
so what is salem like he asked trying to get some sort of clue
i have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time
it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
but none of that is from the pyramids said the alchemist
it's called the principle of favorability beginner's luck
and above all don't forget to follow your destiny through to its conclusion
and there were dunes rocks and plants that insisted on living where survival seemed impossible
that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
then one day the boy returned the books to the englishman
even from a distance their eyes conveyed the strength of their souls
when i'm eating that's all i think about
and you've told me nothing along the way said the boy
the wind's curiosity was aroused something that had never happened before
maybe it was because they moved around so much
i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port
all i saw was an army said the boy
go back to watching the caravan he said
for a moment everything was dark and scary
you gave them everything i had the boy said
i have to find a man who knows that universal language
the angel touched the man's shoulder and they were both projected far into the future
i wanted to sleep a little longer he thought
a part of me is also trying to come to terms with the fact that i won't be able to travel as much anymore
the three fell silent
and at that i told him and he took my place
the sea has lived on in this shell because that's its destiny
he condemned the commander to death without honor
the alchemist turned to the boy
i understand sheep they're no longer a problem and they can be good friends
worked hard just to have food and water like the sheep
there was a general movement backwards
love required them to stay with the people they loved
you must love the desert but never trust it completely
he didn't consider mending the hole ‚äî the stones could fall through any time they wanted
there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
i was wondering if you would work on this project with me because i can‚äôt find anyone else
the alchemist erased the circle in the sand and the snake slithered away among the rocks
why did you want to see me the boy asked
that's the principle that governs all things he said
the men of the desert were already familiar with that wind
then he took from his knapsack a bottle of wine and drank some
they didn't have the printing press in those days the boy argued
all who went there were happy at having done so
with the wars between the tribes it's impossible to cross the desert
i have had the same dream twice he said
there the alchemist separated the disk into four parts
after all who doesn‚äôt want to overcome new challenges and achieve great heights
this is for you he said holding one of the parts out to the monk
he won't leave the circle
if you have to wait until the war is over then wait
the englishman said nothing
the following night the boy appeared at the alchemist's tent with a horse
and he gave the boy his blessing
it made me very depressed
he began to dig at the base of the sycamore
it was better than the scent of the hookahs
remember that wherever your heart is there you will find your treasure
not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view
the old man knew how to read and had already read the book
he knew how to shear them and how to slaughter them
the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didn't matter
they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation
i waited all afternoon and evening he said
when he had completed the cleaning he asked the man for something to eat
what good is money to you if you're going to die
here i am between my flock and my treasure the boy thought
when he reached the top of the dune his heart leapt
well it's a long list
air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
the book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists
for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
what is love the desert asked
he knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in
you're in luck you two the fat arab said
the boy watched as his companion went to his horse and withdrew a scimitar
the alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear
but the boy was quiet
two horsemen waiting ahead of them
on the following day the first clear sign of danger appeared
maybe tomorrow said the boy moving away
i don't want to change anything because i don't know how to deal with change
the boy was surprised at his thoughts
the other son was a poet and delighted all of rome with his beautiful verses
the simum blew that day as it had never blown before
if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
some storms are worth the wreckage
now leave us alone said the boy to the young arab
but most important he was able every day to live out his dream
and ask for a glass of wine for me
dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
i'm an old superstitious arab and i believe in our proverbs
neighbors moved away and there remained only a few small shops on the hill
they went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to set
it sounded like a gypsy prayer
the boy's name was santiago
they mounted their horses
his father said no more
but the boy knew that he was referring to fatima
but i was also stumbling because i couldn‚äôt look away from these things
i have to separate out the sulfur
there was nothing to hold him back except himself
in any case the desert was impassable
it's going to take a while the boy said
i kept my eyes fixed on the cylinder and began pushing my way back from the edge of the pit
the shepherd swore that he would
he was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned
the alchemist's words echoed out like a curse
the whole creature heaved and pulsated convulsively
you can't believe it's not butter
just as your grandfather taught you
a breeze began to blow
i am following my destiny
that's not true the boy said
the boy offered his bottle hoping that the old man would leave him alone
all the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared
he understands the forces of nature
they become a part of everything
he wants me to write down only things that i think about but not things i plan to do
he disappeared into the tent
only the lights in the great tent remained
but he still couldn't flee
i thought that someday i'd be rich and could go to mecca
all this happened between sunrise and sunset the boy thought
i'm not afraid of failing
all things are one the boy thought
it's a nice walk though with trees and a river and stuff
do you know what they're up to
do you see that
what have you there
wow this is a nice table
there's a variety of possibilities but the checkerboard pattern doesn't seem appropriate here
hey don't go there
forty two is not a random number
will you give me those stamps
i won't shut up
have you got my dough
keep me here until i get over it
have you notified the police
a man doesn't get in a situation like this every day
he deleted five tables from the database
you got fifty cents
i've got to talk to you straight from the shoulder
a crowd of people stood around the fountain
dennis was not a business man
we have that all figured out
it took her a while to get used to it
you guys better quit politics and take in washing
i've handled a good many big promotions in my time
look at those shoulders

and this is your coat
well then stand up

you're just like father used to be
hurry up and we'll go out
will you put that thing away
mr nelson come yet
they enjoyed the silence
how does anything like this ever start
can i help you pack
too bad i couldn't see this guy first
it's a beautiful miracle
she's accused of stealing a watch
apparently it's the dumplings that make this stew taste so good
they all say they wrote the letter
can i at least keep the onion soup
she'll be all right
when she tried to withdraw some money from her bank account the atm claimed her card was invalid
i never had any such idea
i told you to practice
i'm in the pink of condition
my father fell in love with him
why do you think i brought you here
what are they gonna think about you
did you know there's a swimming pool under this floor
the space station rocked violently due to the intense pressure wave from the airlock failure
will you trust him that he does it right

the priest collapsed backwards
let me talk to him
the article seems to propose replacing the method of approximate nearest neighbor search
shakespeare never said that

it is rare that i get to sit down and write during the day
i wonder what's keeping mother

for example instead of editing google maps consider contributing to openstreetmap
the view had better be worth it
come on in the office here
we used all your imgination to design the place

i'm afraid she'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you
i'd better hustle him up
haven't you got a bullet i can bite
that's big of you
the references were thick and impenetrable
the whole town's in an uproar
happy to know you
read all about it
and will we go places
little spot's gotta be taken care of
a quarter of a million dollars
he said he couldn't have handled it better himself
the river babbled inanely to itself
i'm terribly sorry she isn't here
what's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist

i have disabled some of the certificate authorities but they're not grayed out in this list
i would argue that much better global and local contrast enhancement methods exist
this man's going to jump off a roof
you've never been born
rising up late in the morning she gave a big stretch to start the day
my advice is duck and cross with your right
the president just decorated him
get some water quickly
i bet it's a going away present
we know what you're up to
the table was adorned with lavish decorations
the shaking disturbed the rat nest
your age fits you
benjamin repeated the question again but in a commanding way
chess is a simulation of war
i can see a smiling face in the clouds
the plastic barrier shattered
i'm still having trouble with baking
what else are you
worryingly the radio signal became weaker
lemon trees are not yellow it's just the fruit
i'm getting married tomorrow
your crew will do the mop up job
what were you going to write about hillary
let's make a night of it
now what are you going to do
i didn't do anything
you've passed me on the street almost every day
all i say is spit them out
and a labor leader like melville
is she coming back here
how would you like to work for me
you can keep her on
they started right in bribing me
she biked home smiling all the way knowing that she had won
his mother showed him how to download photos from his phone

and a guy named jefferson phillip
you all know me
should be drinking milk
can you see what is beyond the golden birches
the frog had no chance to escape
you keep out of this
thank you very much for everything
the clock was slightly askew
there was no other baggage
this guy stole my watch

what's the matter with you two
the next thing the dope wants is a room
about three hundred thousand
what about higgins against becca
these trousers don't fit very well

never mind the money
she says it's nothing to worry about
carbon dioxide is causing global warming
by tomorrow they'll be calling me bruce baldwin
even me ‚äî i haven't thought of other women since i met the merchant's daughter
this is what was written on the emerald tablet said the alchemist when he had finished
he hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice
i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
the dead soldiers were replaced by others and life went on
maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is
that baker he said to himself without completing the thought
he transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to the miner's foot
in a way so am i he said
servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea
of course the two were unable to do anything
arabs often appeared in the city shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day
but the englishman was exultant
the drivers carried the freight themselves over such treacherous footing and then reloaded the camels
just handling them made him feel better
i know its dimensions and how it behaves
ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
until then he had considered the omens to be things of this world
it was better than the scent of the hookahs
he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
camels are traitorous they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire
worked hard just to have food and water like the sheep
fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent
then she filled her vessel with water and left
do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked
but the king of salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful
the boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across the desert
the boy didn't say anything
he dressed in his arabian clothing of white linen bought especially for this day
the englishman could not contain his excitement
i'm interested only in the present
everything has been written by the same hand
then i don't get paid
the three fell silent
everything in life is an omen said the englishman now closing the journal he was reading
i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
now i can see that it hasn't been too bad
i need to sell some wool the boy told the merchant
they're just a pile of stones
finally after hours of waiting the guard bade the boy enter
on the very first page it described a burial ceremony
but only speak a word and my servant will be healed
they seemed to laugh at him and he laughed back his heart bursting with joy
the years of research the magic symbols the strange words and the laboratory equipment
that's good thought the englishman
i'm already used to the way things are
no one paid any attention to the two travelers
we are part of that soul so we rarely recognize that it is working for us
and also because i know about the soul of the world he thought to himself
it was impossible to remember all the details that he covered in an hour
love required them to stay with the people they loved
they called that discovery the master work ‚äî it was part liquid and part solid
it's what you have always wanted to accomplish
i wanted them to be a part of your inheritance
the boy closed his book
he remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn't even have yet
the next day the boy met the old man at noon
in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
the boy smiled to himself
i am proud of you he said
you knew the whole story
i don't know how to find life in the desert the boy said
the alchemist was a bit daunting but as the boy drank the wine he relaxed
he wasn't an alchemist
but before i go i want to tell you a little story
when he's an old man he's going to spend a month in africa
well i'd like to see their land and see how they live said his son
he rose and made his way back toward the palm trees
all things are one the boy thought
he almost began to tell about his treasure but decided not to do so
when the pan had cooled the monk and the boy looked at it dazzled
now leave us alone said the boy to the young arab
i'm an alchemist simply because i'm an alchemist he said as he prepared the meal
i have known true alchemists the alchemist continued
he must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert
where the sand was more substantial
because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert the boy said
and i'd better read your books said the boy
the boy wanted to take her hand
he doesn't have anything else
neighbors moved away and there remained only a few small shops on the hill
the boy tried to read what was written in the sand
he was older and was carrying a small bucket
there's a caravan leaving today for al fayoum
there was a thud like the fall of a great mass
in some places the ground was covered with the salt of dried up lakes
but they don't count
there are powerful forces on both sides and the war is important to both armies
what are you doing here one of the figures demanded
one day the earth began to tremble and the nile overflowed its banks
as he looked at the stones he felt relieved for some reason
but you don't know about love
he was already re accustomed to desert's silence
it was a cobra whose venom could kill a person in minutes
if he ever decided to leave them they would suffer
the boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure
i been here for hours
i could have helped her

stanley felt exhilarated
the fumes from the traffic was unbearable
i don't know why we don't all have pneumonia
i feel quite ambivalent about the article
the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
and he wasn't faring much better
i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
its lower end was still embedded
had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
and one or two persons were returning
henderson was taking it in
i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
when i returned to the common the sun was setting
it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
he just got a new kite for his birthday
among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
and at that i told him and he took my place
i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
i myself heard nothing of that
henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
most meteorites are more or less rounded
i shall make us some ice cubes
a boy came running towards me
so how will we name all these hurricanes
the streamer of gas came out towards us
at the first glance it was really not very exciting
before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
then suddenly he noticed it with a start
he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
some storms are worth the wreckage
the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
no one seemed to have thought about it that night
then the thing came upon him in a flash
the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
it brought his heart into his mouth
i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
few people realise the immensity of vacancy
the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
can i get a woot woot
in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
and then he perceived it very slowly
the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
most of them were staring quietly at the big table
they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
all that time the martians must have been getting ready
the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
of course the two were unable to do anything
it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
but they were not there
he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
yet it was a little too large for assurance
a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
but now the sounds inside had stopped
many telescopes were pointed at it
i was impatient to see it opened
there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
besides that there was a heap of bicycles
as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
the top had certainly ceased to rotate
it had a diameter of about thirty yards
something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain

the boy said nothing
so he could not be hasty nor impatient
the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
he stuck his hand into the pouch and felt around for one of the stones
he thought that with some patience he'd be able to transform everything into gold
the desert was all sand in some stretches and rocky in others
the boy thought about the crystal merchant
its lower end was still embedded
when he reached the top of the dune his heart leapt
for every ten dead men among our enemies you will receive a piece of gold
it was the first time she had done that
it didn't bring with it the smell of the desert nor the threat of moorish invasion
the boy had noticed that the englishman was irritable and missed his books
if he abandons that pursuit it's because it wasn't truelove
you already know about alchemy
but i'm going to egypt the boy said
i want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes
i was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about what it's like to live and work there
but it is not a class that was requested by our alumni or prospective students
well he thought about that the old man said
maybe she didn't even remember him
without responding the guard entered the tent where he remained for some time
something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded
few people realise the immensity of vacancy
the englishman prodded him and the boy asked her about the man who cured people's illnesses
the people were also praying to heaven for protection
he had seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands
but now the sounds inside had stopped
because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert the boy said
two horsemen waiting ahead of them
this desert was once a sea he said
they rode for the entire day
i told him we could teach her to ignore people who waste her time
he was selling better than ever
and i want you to know that i'm coming back
that's not true the boy said
it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
what are you doing here one of the figures demanded
can't you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language the boy asked
it's what you have always wanted to accomplish
to show you one of life's simple lessons the alchemist answered
my review of the sun one star
but you are forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons i have never known
and their eyes spoke of death
but if you have to go before then go on in pursuit of your dream
he had been so far away that his face wasn't even visible
maybe we'd better ask someone the boy suggested
maybe that's why they always stay close to me
well then we've got a problem
the boy put the stones in his pouch
the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body

the only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion
maybe we're all that way the boy mused
the woman was silent for some time
the boy smiled to himself
the closer he got to the realization of his dream the more difficult things became
the boy was strong and wanted to retaliate but he was in a foreign country
there was a time when for me a camel's whinnying was nothing more than whinnying

the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
the boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day
hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
i still have no idea how to turn myself into the wind the boy repeated
the boy was embarrassed and confessed that he had observed nothing
he had suddenly remembered that in tarifa there was an old woman who interpreted dreams
and they had understood each other perfectly well
there was no need to imprison them the arabs simply confiscated their horses
before the sun had reached its high point five hundred tribesmen appeared on the horizon
the old man returned the book to the boy
that's why i feel that i deserve a part of what you find
you knew the whole story
they eat lunch together often but don‚äôt really talk outside the office
he wanted your money he said
i don't know how to turn them into reality

one night the father had a dream
i looked at the cylinder again and was completely terrified
alchemy is a serious discipline
one afternoon they passed by the encampment of one of the tribes
the levanter was still getting stronger and he felt its force on his face
because you have already lost your savings twice
he put a sign on the door and they went to a small cafe nearby
the sunset faded into twilight before anything else happened
just teach me to be the wind for a few moments the boy said
he really was a king a wise king
why do they make things so complicated he asked the englishman one night
that's true the boy thought
the years of research the magic symbols the strange words and the laboratory equipment
i didn't know shepherds knew how to read said a girl's voice behind him
the boy began again to read his book but he was no longer able to concentrate
i heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist the wind said
there was a murmur from the crowd
no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
they spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didn't understand any of it
all that time the martians must have been getting ready
you gave them everything i had the boy said
first they tried to find him on their own
yes that's what love is
we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
maktub the boy said remembering the crystal merchant
the caravan moved toward the east
the omens will begin insistently to speak of it and you'll try to ignore them
it required no explanation just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time
the next day the boy met the old man at noon
there was no way for everybody to know about alchemy
well then why did you let me do it the boy asked
that doesn't happen to just anyone
and continue to pay heed to the omens
i promised that i would make my own decisions he said to himself
i started to run like crazy and made for the first group of trees
and in that mood he was grateful to be in love
they mounted their horses
sit down and let me treat you to something said the boy
the old man looked disappointed
what is an alchemist he asked finally

he fell asleep and when he awoke the sun was already high
the city was still sleeping
and he vanished around the corner of the plaza
i couldn‚äôt stop staring at it
we're in no hurry the chief answered
everyone when they are young knows what their destiny is
he had studied latin spanish and theology
but in his heart he knew that it did matter
the boy offered his bottle hoping that the old man would leave him alone
that baker he said to himself without completing the thought
his soul must be too primitive to understand those things he thought
the old man knew how to read and had already read the book
but i was also stumbling because i couldn‚äôt look away from these things
then the two went off to have some more tea
but he certainly didn't desire that an army invade the oasis
it brought his heart into his mouth
but you are in the desert
and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
listen to your heart
he was planning as he left the bar
what's your name he asked
here i am between my flock and my treasure the boy thought
people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
i don't want to change anything because i don't know how to deal with change
for a moment everything was dark and scary
you old sorcerer the boy shouted up to the sky
when i'm eating that's all i think about
his heart was heavy and he had been melancholy since the previous night
the alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy's cup
maybe because that wasn't really his dream
coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
i have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert he said
i am definitely open to the idea because i‚äôve always wanted to work as a small business owner
he knew how to shear them and how to slaughter them
strange images passed through my mind
and better still to be alone with one's books
he needs three days answered the alchemist
the other son was a poet and delighted all of rome with his beautiful verses
the boy watched the exchange with fascination
it knew of the boy's talk with the desert because the winds know everything
the alchemist's words echoed out like a curse
the stranger continued to hold the sword at the boy's forehead
then the thing came upon him in a flash
but the crystal merchant had no choice
the gods should not have desires because they don't have destinies
you will never be able to escape from your heart
he looked like an arab which was not unusual in those parts
he carried two dead hawks over his shoulder
he wrote his name boldly at the top of the sheet

he called to the boy and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment
i'll work all night until dawn and i'll clean every piece of crystal in your shop

he had been so far away that his face wasn't even visible

but they don't count

he prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass

a boy came running towards me
but they were not there
there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
strange images passed through my mind
and then he perceived it very slowly
it seemed so safe and tranquil
henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
can i get a woot woot
down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
but that was simply because my eye was tired
the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
most meteorites are more or less rounded
and at that i told him and he took my place
something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
the top had certainly ceased to rotate
at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
its lower end was still embedded
the streamer of gas came out towards us
air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
then came the night of the first falling star
i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
i shall make us some ice cubes
i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
it looked like a rusty gas float
if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
but now the sounds inside had stopped
the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
i wished i had a light to smoke by
the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
most of them were staring quietly at the big table
in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
at the first glance it was really not very exciting
he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
then suddenly he noticed it with a start
i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
it brought his heart into his mouth
coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
yet it was a little too large for assurance
i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
and one or two persons were returning
henderson was taking it in
i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
no one seemed to have thought about it that night
i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
i myself heard nothing of that
a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
few people realise the immensity of vacancy
i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
besides that there was a heap of bicycles
when i returned to the common the sun was setting
dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
they set off running wildly into the trees
some went away while i was there and other people came
'm all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
i was impatient to see it opened
so how will we name all these hurricanes
all that time the martians must have been getting ready
many telescopes were pointed at it
there was very little talking
why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
you can't believe it's not butter
and he wasn't faring much better
the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
it had a diameter of about thirty yards
among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
he just got a new kite for his birthday
he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface

i thought that someday i'd be rich and could go to mecca
none of this ha d made an impression on the boy
they mounted their horses
without such love one's dreams would have no meaning
that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
you must love the desert but never trust it completely
the boy approached her to ask about the alchemist
it required no explanation just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time
their faces were hidden behind blue veils with only their eyes showing
the years of research the magic symbols the strange words and the laboratory equipment
they placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses
the other son was a poet and delighted all of rome with his beautiful verses
it is i the boy answered
i noticed that the boy answered
on the seventh day the alchemist decided to make camp earlier than usual
a young arab also loaded down with baggage entered and greeted the englishman
the dunes are changed by the wind but the desert never changes
what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
i stopped right over there panting and waiting for further developments
yes that's what love is
then suddenly they kneel and die
strange images passed through my mind
no the alchemist answered
it was more activity than usual for this time of the morning
walking along in the silence he had no regrets
you'll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants
who told you that asked the boy startled
the wind has many names
so how will we name all these hurricanes
can't you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language the boy asked
we'll have something to drink and eat these hawks
at the same time people were passing my shop all the time heading for mecca
he could always go back to being a shepherd
but i'm going to egypt the boy said
their faces were covered with the blue cloths and their eyes showed fear
the boy had met the alchemist
and then he would ask us to go back to our easels and replicate all the techniques in one go
the streamer of gas came out towards us
because i don't live in either my past or my future
don't be impatient he repeated to himself
he must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves
the serpent relaxed immediately
i still have no idea how to turn myself into the wind the boy repeated
they're not for sale he said
it spoke of journeys discoveries books and change
but the boy knew that he was referring to fatima
and because the tribes declared war i went to the well seeking the alchemist
the boy was relieved
as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
no one can be from many places the boy said
he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
and yet none of these people has ever met the old king
from here on you will be alone the alchemist said
on the following day the first clear sign of danger appeared
but he certainly didn't desire that an army invade the oasis
and look how many things the wind already knew how to do
he thought of all the married shepherds he had known
your money saved us for three days
if he ever decided to leave them they would suffer
suddenly there is so much more time in a day because she no longer has to spend hours commuting
mary told me that she got to meet up with you while she was back in san francisco
but i'd like to see the castles in the towns where they live the boy explained
one afternoon one of his servants fell ill and it appeared that he would die
the only things that concerned the sheep were food and water
i read only what the birds wanted to tell me
he told me i should try to do so
i used to look at those women and envy them their happiness
an army is coming the boy said
the caravan moved toward the east
well why don't we go there right now the boy asked
i'm afraid that if my dream is realized i'll have no reason to go on living
camels are traitorous they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire
i'm going with you the boy said
that's never happened to me the boy said
the steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon
love required them to stay with the people they loved
that day he didn't make a cast
the meeting was over
he told them all to be seated
always heed the omens the old king had said
it's the master work of the alchemists
but horses tire bit by bit
he didn't consider mending the hole ‚äî the stones could fall through any time they wanted
speak to the hand that wrote all said the sun
you and i aren't like hassan that rich merchant
the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
they crossed the desert for another two days in silence
but none of that mattered to the alchemist
because of the omens the alchemist answered
fill this place with a sandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun
it's going to take a while the boy said
they must be used to their new shepherd and have probably already forgotten me
he knew what i was thinking the boy said to himself
the old man opened his cape and the boy was struck by what he saw
but the crystal merchant had no choice
the two walked out among the palms
listen to your heart
he told fatima that at their next meeting
there was a time when for me a camel's whinnying was nothing more than whinnying
he waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop
the boy fell to the sand nearly unconscious
maktub the boy said remembering the crystal merchant
he took back his books and packed them away again in their bags
i don't know why these things have to be transmitted by word of mouth he thought
until then he had considered the omens to be things of this world
nature knows me as the wisest being in creation the sun said
the scabbard was embossed in silver and the handle was black and encrusted with precious stones
then the two went off to have some more tea
the infidels had an evil look about them
the boy smiled and continued digging
when i first reached through to it i thought the soul of the world was perfect
where was his horse
and the falcon then nourishes man
the men climbed the hill and they were tired when they reached the top
i've already told you
it was better than the scent of the hookahs
back into the excavation
and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
and he gave the boy his blessing
he was more certain of it than of anything in the world
they were given to me as a present by a king the boy said
as he was leaving he saw in the corner of the room his old shepherd's pouch
there is a universal language understood by everybody but already forgotten
the camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree observing the sunset
the following night the boy appeared at the alchemist's tent with a horse
the heat lasted until nightfall and all that time he had to carry his jacket
treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly
the boy trusted his new friend
the drivers carried the freight themselves over such treacherous footing and then reloaded the camels
they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
i'm going into the desert the man answered turning back to his reading
the old man looked disappointed
sometimes their caravan met with another
there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
only in that way would he be able to read the omens
so when i look out over your sands i am also looking at her
all who went there were happy at having done so
the merchants were assembling their stalls and the boy helped a candy seller to do his
he still had some doubts about the decision he had made
the two were taken to a nearby military camp
now leave us alone said the boy to the young arab
it reminded him of the wool from his sheep
there's one that says 'everything that happens once can never happen again
it was bunched up and he had hardly thought of it for a long time
the omens will begin insistently to speak of it and you'll try to ignore them
he really was a king a wise king
this desert was once a sea he said
it was the levanter the wind that came from africa
i wished i had a light to smoke by
i was wondering if you would work on this project with me because i can‚äôt find anyone else
we're refugees from the tribal wars and we need money the other figure said
in order to find the treasure you will have to follow the omens
they never found the secret
my friend bought all the other sheep immediately
at the first glance it was really not very exciting
for a moment everything was dark and scary
first they tried to find him on their own
from then on the boy understood his heart
a lot of patience but shepherds know all about patience
go and speak to the tribal chieftains said the camel driver
everywhere there were stalls with items for sale
after all who doesn‚äôt want to overcome new challenges and achieve great heights
it's not easy to find the philosopher's stone said the englishman
don't hurt my finger again
that‚äôs because i want to remove the old grout from the bathroom tile
just one thing more
any edition is fine and i use the premium edition
the question of ownership would seem to be a more complicated one
what is today
classification is among other things a discipline of machine learning
i got two nice guitars from there
a musical note sustained to its full length with no break between it and the next note
solfaing system of arranging the scale of music by the names do re mi fa sol la si a voice exercise
so it's better to listen to what it has to say
that's why i feel that i deserve a part of what you find
i didn't need to waste my time just for this he said
replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
the alchemist dismounted and told the escorts they could return to the camp
the boy thought about the crystal merchant
the mixture took on a reddish color almost the color of blood
everything in life is an omen said the englishman now closing the journal he was reading
they dismounted and the alchemist said nothing
i'm not going to charge you anything now she said
but maybe people who felt that way had never learned the universal language
and he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes
he arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept
in his heart he wanted to remain awake but he also wanted to sleep
you would have to have been born an arab to understand he answered
don't say that again
the boy trusted his new friend
no one attacks an oasis
you have a mania for simplifying everything answered the englishman irritated
there are powerful forces on both sides and the war is important to both armies
tangier is not like the rest of africa
the wind began to pick up
but he kept quiet because he had heard what the alchemist said to the monk
he fell asleep and when he awoke the sun was already high
that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
i asked him to let me use the kitchen for a while the alchemist smiled
dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church
three days from now he would be with the merchant's daughter
people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
when i returned to the common the sun was setting
the serpent relaxed immediately
he had studied latin spanish and theology
all they wanted was food and water
but he had found a guide and didn't want to miss out on an opportunity
the boy became fearful the omens told him that something was wrong
he listened to the wind and felt the stones beneath his feet
the sword didn't fall
he wandered for a while keeping the date palms of the oasis within sight
let's get out of here said the new arrival
he decided to spend the night there
but now the sounds inside had stopped
from where i am the sun said i can see the soul of the world
i used to live near el cairum he said
the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
in any case it's good that you've learned that everything in life has its price
your money saved us for three days
you old sorcerer the boy shouted up to the sky
then taking his sheep he walked away
the city was still sleeping
it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
the horse reared again raising a cloud of dust
suddenly for no apparent reason the boy's horse began to slow
gypsies are experts at getting people to do that sighed the old man
that he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen
a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
his soul must be too primitive to understand those things he thought
they rode for the entire day
in those times the master work could be written simply on an emerald
it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
the boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy but saw none
it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
i want to see him do it said the chief
the war continued and at times the wind carried the sweet sickly smell of blood
well it's a long list
his hands began to tremble and the woman sensed it
finally a young woman approached who was not dressed in black
it had a diameter of about thirty yards
well usually i learn more from my sheep than from books he answered
and one or two persons were returning
as he looked at the stones he felt relieved for some reason
don't be impatient he repeated to himself
he transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to the miner's foot
the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
fill this place with a sandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun
we're in no hurry the chief answered
i understand sheep they're no longer a problem and they can be good friends
where your treasure is there also will be your heart the alchemist had told him
he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
the boy was relieved
then it became a signal of danger
maybe we're all that way the boy mused
they crossed the desert for another two days in silence
down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
so how will we name all these hurricanes
i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
then he turned to the boy
i'll work for you he said
the old man looked disappointed
but the boy couldn't even speak
there was a murmur from the crowd
the boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure
the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
speak to the hand that wrote all said the sun
one day the earth began to tremble and the nile overflowed its banks
i don't like people to do that because the sheep are afraid of strangers
but the king of salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful
without responding the guard entered the tent where he remained for some time
when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
without such love one's dreams would have no meaning
so then try he said to the englishman
but as time passed tangier had changed
they become a part of everything
there is only one way to learn the alchemist answered
having heard that the boy became even more interested in alchemy
i have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time
as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
the boy looked out at the horizon
there was a murmur from the crowd
the boy had met the alchemist
in some places the ground was covered with the salt of dried up lakes
they never have to make any decisions he thought
you know what i mean
your behavior is embarrassing go learn the art of social intercourse
the mall is open eight thirty am to five thirty pm
a poor man is better than a liar
the beer was more than just refreshing it was delicious

because he was terrified the boy didn't answer
he could always go back to being a shepherd
instead the stranger lowered it slowly until the point touched the boy's forehead
he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
another trick the boy thought
at the camp it was difficult to see anything
he wanted your money he said
did you say a king he asked
an alchemist said the alchemist
then suddenly he noticed it with a start
and you ought to read more about the world answered the englishman
why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument
but most important he was able every day to live out his dream

we're just slowly plodding through some user interviews at the moment
i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy

i want to see him do it said the chief
the boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day
yet each felt his heart beat a bit faster
you'd better get dressed
it spoke of journeys discoveries books and change
maybe because that wasn't really his dream
he stuck his hand into the pouch and felt around for one of the stones
the stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about
it was the first time either had touched the other
the boy waited and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted
they called that discovery the master work ‚äî it was part liquid and part solid
it was bunched up and he had hardly thought of it for a long time

it's the oasis said the camel driver
i am proud of you he said
if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
he wanted to forget about the vision and return to his meditation
so now i fear nothing because it was those omens that brought you to me
the only things that concerned the sheep were food and water
that's the magic of omens said the boy
i'll be back the boy said
they were looking only for gold his companion answered
the boy promised himself that when he returned from egypt he would buy that sword
this man looked exactly the same except that now the roles were reversed
that's the principle that governs all things he said
i wished i had a light to smoke by
the boy didn't know what a person's destiny was
it knew of the boy's talk with the desert because the winds know everything
i asked him to let me use the kitchen for a while the alchemist smiled
i found these one day in the fields
it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand

an army is coming the boy said
no one can be from many places the boy said
all that time the martians must have been getting ready
the boy went to his room and packed his belongings
he recited an our father silently
he seemed unfriendly and had looked irritated when the boy had entered
his heart squeezed as if his chest had suddenly compressed it
they placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses
and i'd better read your books said the boy
that's good thought the englishman
i'd like you to take me there if you can
this is for you he said holding one of the parts out to the monk
vibrations of peace throughout the tent

he just got a new kite for his birthday
the alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery
it knew of the boy's talk with the desert because the winds know everything
they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
he walked slowly through the market
the day was dawning and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun
and i will tell you how to find the hidden treasure
until then he had considered the omens to be things of this world
it's no miracle because i see it happen once every year
and he wasn't faring much better
am i going to find my treasure he asked
the stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about
the caravan moved toward the east
every day was there to be lived or to mark one's departure from this world
he paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the egyptian pyramids were
and continue to pay heed to the omens
he could sell the stones and buy a return ticket
they went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to set
mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies
show me where there is life out in the desert
he had understood the story the old king had told him
that makes sense the alchemist answered
it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
he was learning a lot of new things
and the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have
help my son megan tonight
but the boy never took his eye off his new friend
last time i made the mistake of replicating a drawing by rodin
so now i fear nothing because it was those omens that brought you to me
instead the stranger lowered it slowly until the point touched the boy's forehead
but the king of salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful
i'm coming fatima he said
have trusted more in your love for fatima
the boy looked out at the horizon
the boy was strong and wanted to retaliate but he was in a foreign country
one afternoon they passed by the encampment of one of the tribes
well i'd like to see their land and see how they live said his son
he wanted to forget about the vision and return to his meditation
the englishman prodded him and the boy asked her about the man who cured people's illnesses
so he began to wander through the city and found himself at the gates
all the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared
but bakers are more important people than shepherds
all this happened between sunrise and sunset the boy thought
it had a diameter of about thirty yards
throughout the night the boy dug at the place he had chosen but found nothing
but i felt miserable watching him wither away like a shriveled dandelion
the boy climbed the dune slowly
he ran his fingers slowly over the stones sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces
no one paid any attention to the two travelers
the desert didn't answer him for a few moments
it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
finally a young woman approached who was not dressed in black
the men were smoking their hookahs and trading stories from the battlefield
but then they wouldn't be a part of your future the seer had said
you will never be able to escape from your heart
what does he do all day
although everything should be under the state's control there is a lot of violence in prisons
but finally he agreed that the boy who spoke better arabic than he should do so
go and speak to the tribal chieftains said the camel driver
and he immediately felt peace in his heart
then she again took his hands and studied them carefully

he was planning as he left the bar
the steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon
maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership
don't let them see that you're afraid the alchemist said
he was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned
we've done it said the englishman who had also awakened early
he started to read the book he had bought

divers found a dead person in the lake
the alchemist stopped abruptly and bent to the ground
the boy was embarrassed and confessed that he had observed nothing
it was a tent like many at the oasis
they were looking only for gold his companion answered
but he granted the travelers three days
all they ever do really is look for food and water
the old man wore a breastplate of gold and he knew about my past
had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
the boy repeated his question
he didn't know the man yet but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared
now it will be with hope
in his hand he grasped a snake by the tail
the desert was all sand in some stretches and rocky in others
if what one finds is made of pure matter it will never spoil
no one can be from many places the boy said
they called that discovery the master work ‚äî it was part liquid and part solid
the alchemist erased the circle in the sand and the snake slithered away among the rocks
on the following day the first clear sign of danger appeared
in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
the camel driver was not a fighter and he had consulted with seers
but they could never have taught him arabic
the men were smoking their hookahs and trading stories from the battlefield
that doesn't happen to just anyone
i know its dimensions and how it behaves
if good things are coming they will be a pleasant surprise said the seer
don't be impatient he repeated to himself
the horse reared again raising a cloud of dust
they mounted their horses and rode out in the direction of the pyramids of egypt
but he kept the sword in his hand

one afternoon one of his servants fell ill and it appeared that he would die
he said that everything has its own destiny
there is no wine in this country the young man said
in order to find the treasure you will have to follow the omens
once you get into the desert there's no going back said the camel driver
he started to read the book he had bought
i used to live near el cairum he said
he put a sign on the door and they went to a small cafe nearby
they wanted to save the oasis
if he ever decided to leave them they would suffer
another person was there to help him toward his destiny
he had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind
you can't believe it's not butter
i need it to get to the pyramids he said
he listened to the wind and felt the stones beneath his feet
they were known as seers and they were held in fear by women and the elderly
they become the soul o f the world
he picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch
he needs three days answered the alchemist
the old man said nothing
the old man leafed through the book and fell to reading a page he came to
that's true the boy thought
the tea seemed less bitter
i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
why a revolver he asked
but there's a tribal war the boy reiterated
that's the way it will be with our love for each other
they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
well then we've got a problem
a part of me is also trying to come to terms with the fact that i won't be able to travel as much anymore
and he wasn't faring much better
the englishman asked if they were in danger
only in that way would he be able to read the omens
in some places the ground was covered with the salt of dried up lakes
life attracts life the alchemist answered
i have been waiting for her to respond for two days now so i just went ahead and did it for her
continue in the direction of the pyramids said the alchemist
but before i go i want to tell you a little story
at his side was the young arab the boy had spoken with earlier
suddenly for no apparent reason the boy's horse began to slow
he left without saying good bye to the crystal merchant
toward the end of the afternoon they came upon a coptic monastery
there was a small building there with a window at which people bought tickets to africa
the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
he followed the movement of the birds trying to read something into it
everyone on earth has a treasure that awaits him his heart said
the boy climbed the dune slowly
but fatima's hands held to the handles of her jug
three armed tribesmen approached and asked what the boy and the alchemist were doing there
he called to the boy and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment
i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
because he was terrified the boy didn't answer
he was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned
a current of love rushed from his heart and the boy began to pray
i heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist the wind said
but the englishman was exultant
they're not my sheep anymore he said to himself without nostalgia
the sun was turned into a golden disk
i'm not going to charge you anything now she said
the emerald tablet is a direct passage to the soul of the world

what is an alchemist he asked finally
and now it was only four days before he would be back in that same village
i learned the alchemist's secrets in my travels
everyone has his or her own way of learning things he said to himself
with every day that passed the boy's heart became more and more silent
it turned out to be a bitter tea
the boy thought of fatima
be careful with your prognostications said the stranger
'everyone loved them and enjoyed them
it's almost as if he had been here and left his mark he thought
it didn't even occur to the boy to flee
the genies were the spirits of good and evil
i'm going away he said
then she filled her vessel with water and left
they have gotten used to my being away and so have i
two horsemen waiting ahead of them
all i saw was an army said the boy
he knelt down to find urim and thummim and put them back in the pouch

so now i fear nothing because it was those omens that brought you to me
because he was terrified the boy didn't answer
so he could not be hasty nor impatient
the boy thanked him ate it and went on his way
the shepherd swore that he would
he knew he was stronger than his friend
the boy was embarrassed and confessed that he had observed nothing
so when i look out over your sands i am also looking at her
and then the boy understood
i am in search of that universal language among other things
enough said the boy
i'm going to go back to doing just what i did before the boy thought
yes that's what love is
he took back his books and packed them away again in their bags
he regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert
be careful with your prognostications said the stranger
it's easy and yet i've never done it before he thought
the mixture took on a reddish color almost the color of blood
he told them all to be seated
then like a colony of worker ants they dismantled their stalls and left
the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
you could have died after peace had been declared
i am following my destiny
so then try he said to the englishman
the war continued and at times the wind carried the sweet sickly smell of blood
fatima the girl said averting her eyes
what is it you're looking for asked the old merchant
walking along in the silence he had no regrets
you are almost at the end of your journey said the alchemist
the alchemist turned to the boy
and that's where the power of love comes in
what do i do in salem the old man laughed
it's like the camel driver said 'eat when it's time to eat
the merchant looked anxiously at the boy
i don't want to change anything because i don't know how to deal with change
and he gave the boy his blessing
there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
but then he remembered that he wasn't going to have to pay anything
in alchemy it's called the soul of the world
younger man what he had seen and the man asked him to wait there
but instead of being saddened he was happy
he put his headcloth in place and secured it with a ring made of camel skin
and to do that you need money
well it's a long list
people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
the alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear
but he granted the travelers three days
the wind began to blow again
this is for you he said holding one of the parts out to the monk
from where i am the sun said i can see the soul of the world
when he's an old man he's going to spend a month in africa
but only speak a word and my servant will be healed
the boy awoke before dawn
there was very little talking
what is a foreigner doing here asked another of the men
trust in your heart but never forget that you're in the desert
the war is going to end someday the girl said
the boy promised himself that when he returned from egypt he would buy that sword
he saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes
and ask for a glass of wine for me
and don't forget the language of omens
it was a cobra whose venom could kill a person in minutes
so how will we name all these hurricanes
he thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert
i was impatient to see it opened
in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
as the englishman left fatima arrived and filled her vessel with water
the two men exchanged some words in arabic and the bar owner seemed irritated
he didn't consider mending the hole ‚äî the stones could fall through any time they wanted
that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
where is the treasure he asked
the invaders carried the name everywhere the beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride
then one day the boy returned the books to the englishman
well why don't we go there right now the boy asked
it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port
no one attacks an oasis
the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
the caravan began to travel day and night
then she filled her vessel with water and left
they didn't have the printing press in those days the boy argued
then she again took his hands and studied them carefully
show me where there is life out in the desert
back into the excavation
as was mecca for the merchant
nearby was the englishman reading a book
and in that mood he was grateful to be in love
these are the spies said one of the men
he dressed in his arabian clothing of white linen bought especially for this day
i know good crystal from bad and everything else there is to know about crystal
he put a sign on the door and they went to a small cafe nearby
then i don't get paid
his heart squeezed as if his chest had suddenly compressed it
i've been looking for you all morning he said as he led the boy outside
what's the fifth obligation the boy asked
just by looking at them
the battles may last for a long time perhaps even years
that doesn't happen to just anyone
the old man leafed through the book and fell to reading a page he came to
looking down at the spoon he held the boy saw that the oil was gone
well interpret the dream he said
we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
but if you can try to make your own decisions
i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
it's what you have always wanted to accomplish
when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
never stop dreaming the old king had said
he remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn't even have yet
imagine if everyone went around transforming lead into gold
why did you want to see me the boy asked
that's good thought the englishman
the boy tried to read what was written in the sand
the englishman vanished too gone to find the alchemist
the boy was becoming nervous
camels are traitorous they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire
the emerald tablet is a direct passage to the soul of the world
he won't leave the circle
the desert didn't answer him for a few moments
well i'd like to see their land and see how they live said his son
let me tell you what will happen
he really was a king
and it knew nothing about love
the same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip
i have already found my treasure
how did you learn to read the girl asked at one point
i'm a desert woman and i'm proud of that
gypsies are experts at getting people to do that sighed the old man
the meeting was over
everyone when they are young knows what their destiny is
it's the emerald tablet said the englishman proud that he might teach something to the boy
the boy thought of fatima
that's what alchemists do
we're refugees from the tribal wars and we need money the other figure said
for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
i've learned things from the sheep and i've learned things from crystal he thought
it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
but fatima's hands held to the handles of her jug
he still had some doubts about the decision he had made
those are the rules of war the leader explained
what is an alchemist he asked finally
what are they doing the old man asked pointing at the people in the plaza
the boy said nothing
at other times at a crucial moment i make it easier for things to happen
there must be a language that doesn't depend on words the boy thought
he had been to the village only once the year before
the man was speaking the language of alchemy
the dead soldiers were replaced by others and life went on
the desert was all sand in some stretches and rocky in others
i'm not hiding anything the boy answered
he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
should i understand the emerald tablet the boy asked
that it was unable to deal with this boy who spoke the language of the world
when he reached the top of the dune his heart leapt
an old man with a breastplate of gold wouldn't have lied just to acquire six sheep
he fell asleep and when he awoke the sun was already high
then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments looking at the sword
tell me more about your dream said the woman
advancing slowly they searched among the stones
if he ever decided to leave them they would suffer
the idea frightened him
he just got a new kite for his birthday
it's too bad that he's quickly going to forget my name he thought
but the englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it
he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
he needs three days answered the alchemist
in a way so am i he said
it is i who dared to do so said the boy
he's doing it because it's what he wants to do
i hold the power of life and death for every person i take with me
they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation
the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
every search begins with beginner's luck
i just know that the tradition is always right
the boy leapt as well but away from the alchemist
the boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things
it helped me to trust in people the englishman answered
what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
it spoke of journeys discoveries books and change
the miner had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds
the camel driver though seemed not to be very concerned with the threat of war
they must be used to their new shepherd and have probably already forgotten me
something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
the two walked out among the palms
i want to see him do it said the chief
it brought his heart into his mouth
when he had completed the cleaning he asked the man for something to eat
drink and enjoy yourself said the alchemist noticing that the boy was feeling happier
most meteorites are more or less rounded
he wanted your money he said
the englishman prodded him and the boy asked her about the man who cured people's illnesses
vibrations of peace throughout the tent
the alchemists spent years in their laboratories observing the fire that purified the metals
you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
now it will be with hope
maybe that's why they always stay close to me
the englishman was disappointed
he understands the forces of nature
at the same time people were passing my shop all the time heading for mecca
i'll be back the boy said
the boy's name was santiago
they're just a pile of stones
there is no wine in this country the young man said
from atop its walls one can catch a glimpse of africa
a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
it had a diameter of about thirty yards
why would a king be talking with a shepherd the boy asked awed and embarrassed
and continue to pay heed to the omens
he knew what i was thinking the boy said to himself
he had come to the town only to find a woman who could interpret his dream
it's true that everything has its destiny but one day that destiny will be realized
i've never had one before the merchant answered
my friend bought all the other sheep immediately
the tea seemed less bitter
at that point the omens will tell you that your treasure is buried forever
he listened to the wind and felt the stones beneath his feet
the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
one day the earth began to tremble and the nile overflowed its banks
the tradition teaches men how to cross the desert and how their children should marry
he had been so far away that his face wasn't even visible
i'll work for you he said
well usually i learn more from my sheep than from books he answered
the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
the soul of the world is nourished by people's happiness
at that point in their lives everything is clear and everything is possible
hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
but the boy knew that he was referring to fatima
there was no way for everybody to know about alchemy

but i'm going to egypt the boy said

the land was ruined and i had to find some other way to earn a living
the alchemist stopped abruptly and bent to the ground
strange images passed through my mind
you could have died after peace had been declared
because he was terrified the boy didn't answer
he could always go back to being a shepherd
they provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes
everyone on earth has a treasure that awaits him his heart said
when you are loved you can do anything in creation
as he was leaving he saw in the corner of the room his old shepherd's pouch
every search begins with beginner's luck
the arabs laughed at him and the alchemist laughed along
and above all don't forget to follow your destiny through to its conclusion
he got up adjusted his clothing and picked up his pouch
he was selling better than ever
just handling them made him feel better
and i will tell you how to find the hidden treasure
they become a part of everything
because you have already lost your savings twice
it seemed as if what the old king had called beginner's luck were no longer functioning
where are you bound asked the young arab
the three fell silent
not even the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to
that's why i feel that i deserve a part of what you find
the old man returned the book to the boy
and your camels will bring you wealth and power
don't be impatient he repeated to himself
he made us stand and watch him paint for like an hour
the boy and the englishman had bought camels and climbed uncertainly onto their backs
my name is melchizedek said the old man
i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
worked hard just to have food and water like the sheep
to continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon fatima
we're just slowly plodding through some user interviews at the moment
i asked him to let me use the kitchen for a while the alchemist smiled
all things are one the boy thought
he listened to the wind and felt the stones beneath his feet
he had come to the town only to find a woman who could interpret his dream
suddenly for no apparent reason the boy's horse began to slow
the boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy but saw none
maybe we'd better ask someone the boy suggested
am i going to find my treasure he asked
the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
the old man wore a breastplate of gold and he knew about my past
so he could not be hasty nor impatient
many of them had been right about what they said while some had been wrong
you would have to have been born an arab to understand he answered
you have told me about your dreams about the old king and your treasure
everything has been written by the same hand
that makes sense the alchemist answered
he decided to stay right there and await his return
to show you one of life's simple lessons the alchemist answered
the shepherd said nothing
another dreamer said the ticket seller to his assistant watching the boy walk away
it knew of the boy's talk with the desert because the winds know everything
i've had this shop for thirty years
he has other things to do first

what was written on the emerald tablet the boy wanted to know

and that he a boy could perform miracles
the tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do
well interpret the dream he said
i saw a young man standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again
the camel drivers exchanged information about windstorms and told stories about the desert
in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
he really was a king
the man was speaking the language of alchemy
be careful with your prognostications said the stranger
i have been waiting for her to respond for two days now so i just went ahead and did it for her
the alchemist followed as the boy's horse ran for almost half an hour
he was tense and upset because he knew that the old man was right
the boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across the desert
the alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery
the merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses
now it will be with hope
he took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young man
it was difficult not to think about what he had left behind
he seemed unfriendly and had looked irritated when the boy had entered
they dismounted and the alchemist said nothing
he reached over and picked up a shell from the ground
the steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon
and i'm certain you'll find it the alchemist said
it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
they also began to feel that they knew a better way than others had
finally a young woman approached who was not dressed in black
he hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice
it's a man who understands nature and the world
thank you said the boy
but he kept quiet because he had heard what the alchemist said to the monk
i'm a woman of the desert she said averting her face
of course the two were unable to do anything
i don't know why
the englishman was disappointed
the miner had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds
and look how many things the wind already knew how to do
they wanted to save the oasis
the treasure is at the pyramids that you already knew
i looked at the cylinder again and was completely terrified

a couple of army men playing baseball
a small black and white jumping to catch something in its mouth
it was a bundle of money
he sat looking at the sky for a long time
the old man was probably a gypsy too
i know its dimensions and how it behaves
i'm going into the desert the man answered turning back to his reading
so he could not be hasty nor impatient
my friend bought all the other sheep immediately
and it's not love to see everything from a distance like you do
the sheep had taught him that
he decided to spend the night there
sometimes there's just no way to hold back the river
but it is not a class that was requested by our alumni or prospective students
the boy approached her to ask about the alchemist
advancing slowly they searched among the stones
why did you want to see me the boy asked
he said that everything has its own destiny
you are almost at the end of your journey said the alchemist
the closer he got to the realization of his dream the more difficult things became
let's get out of here said the new arrival
the old man leafed through the book and fell to reading a page he came to
my name is melchizedek said the old man
not to worry said the alchemist
like eating or sleeping or like seeking love or finding a job
it's not often that money can save someone's life
he didn't want to cry with the other people there
men dream more about coming home than about leaving the boy said
they ate in silence
fatima is a woman of the desert said the alchemist
the boy was getting irritated
his father said no more
because of the omens the alchemist answered
but in his heart he knew that it did matter
replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
camels are traitorous they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire
when you are in love things make even more sense he thought
i'm interested only in the present
fill this place with a sandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun
before long maybe in just a few days he would be at the pyramids
they stood there looking at the moon
it's like the camel driver said 'eat when it's time to eat
you'll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants
for a moment everything was dark and scary
the boy awoke before dawn
i only interpret dreams
now it will be with hope
he was alarmed by what had happened
he was older and was carrying a small bucket
an alchemist said the alchemist
maybe that's why they give up on it so early too
all this happened between sunrise and sunset the boy thought
what he said reminded the boy of the old king
when i had my sheep i was happy and i made those around me happy
our merchants bought that man and brought him to egypt
to continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon fatima
that's the magic of omens said the boy
the streamer of gas came out towards us
he thought of all the married shepherds he had known
they made the boy continue digging but he found nothing
the men fell into an animated discussion
they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation
he listened to the wind and felt the stones beneath his feet
everything you need to know you have learned through your journey
some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
don‚äôt share your opinions so readily because you never know who is listening
i don't know how to find life in the desert the boy said
one can‚äôt be too careful
regarding your request i have decided to heed your warnings
the book has been wrong in the past

i'd still like to have a word with her
if my stepfather sold this old sculpture he'd probably become a millionaire
it would certainly fulfil the requirements of my contract
seoul has two main airports one at incheon and another one at gimpo
at the airport the woman threw herself into revision for college so she could experience university
like master like man
ten years at the university and here i am in a corral
but you will love her and she'll return your love
here i am between my flock and my treasure the boy thought
i could die happily and that made me feel good
he took the fourth part and handed it to the monk
it was the pure language of the world
and in that mood he was grateful to be in love
the steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon
those gangsters get what they deserve
a tow truck came to clear up the wreckage
the square peg will settle in the round hole
after writing a bug report one should regularly check if someone responded

what was all that
congressman aaron is here to see you
the funny thing about the horizon is that you can't reach it
the picnic was ruined by a marching band
oh my dear child
according to the calendar it was september
the old man opened his cape and the boy was struck by what he saw
the alchemist turned to the boy
the boy went to his room and packed his belongings
when i first reached through to it i thought the soul of the world was perfect
the day was hot and the wine was refreshing
don't say that again
he had suddenly remembered that in tarifa there was an old woman who interpreted dreams
i'm hunting with my falcon the alchemist answered
even when all you want to do is travel
as he did so he talked with the monk about the tribal wars
you could have died after peace had been declared
he was shaken into wakefulness by someone
but he still couldn't flee
but you are in the desert
he doesn't have anything else
the alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear
having heard that the boy became even more interested in alchemy
it was the old man who spoke first
the merchant was silent for a few moments
yes or even search for treasure
everyone on earth has a treasure that awaits him his heart said
the boy was surprised at his thoughts
it's what you have always wanted to accomplish
that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
he must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert
that's true enough the boy thought ruefully
he disappeared into the tent
treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly
i thought that everything i owned would be destroyed
i'd like you to take me there if you can
he had come to the town only to find a woman who could interpret his dream
mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies
and don't forget the language of omens
but he kept the sword in his hand
this is for you he said holding one of the parts out to the monk
the boy was surprised and then irritated
trust in your heart but never forget that you're in the desert
and then there were the others who were interested only in gold
what good is money to you if you're going to die
do you know what i mean
i wish you'd forget about us
it's easy for you to talk
what's she up to
his dessert smelled musty not sweet
they'd never let you go
the smell was noxious
isn't it all too wonderful
take your card and leave it with him
there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
a boy came running towards me
the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
of course the two were unable to do anything
a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
but he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind
it seemed so safe and tranquil
but that was simply because my eye was tired
what's the world's greatest lie the boy asked completely surprised
then came the night of the first falling star
'm all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
but as he saw them lying there on the ground another phrase came to his mind
you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
some went away while i was there and other people came
the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
the old man was probably a gypsy too
i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
yet it was a little too large for assurance
some storms are worth the wreckage
the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
fatima was more important than his treasure
i waited all afternoon and evening he said
for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
so how will we name all these hurricanes
he wasn't an alchemist
the boy was relieved
then you'll die in the midst of trying to realize your destiny
the only things that concerned the sheep were food and water
that's good thought the englishman
what's the fifth obligation the boy asked
maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is
you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
he had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist
i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
the boy watched as his companion went to his horse and withdrew a scimitar
at the first glance it was really not very exciting
the steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon
and i'm certain you'll find it the alchemist said
he condemned the commander to death without honor
he took out his money and counted it
that's the way it always is said the old man
never stop dreaming the old king had said
and he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved
every day was there to be lived or to mark one's departure from this world
it's like the flight of those two hawks it can't be understood by reason alone
when he had completed the cleaning he asked the man for something to eat
sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
that doesn't happen to just anyone
you have a mania for simplifying everything answered the englishman irritated
but bakers are more important people than shepherds
the conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss
the old man leafed through the book and fell to reading a page he came to
when he reached the top of the dune his heart leapt
so he could not be hasty nor impatient
in alchemy it's called the soul of the world
the boy looked out at the horizon
he reached over and picked up a shell from the ground
few people realise the immensity of vacancy
all this happened between sunrise and sunset the boy thought
the englishman said nothing
that's true enough the boy thought ruefully
then he took from his knapsack a bottle of wine and drank some
so he began to wander through the city and found himself at the gates
there's no danger the boy said when they had moved on past the encampment
the boy spent a sleepless night
and better still to be alone with one's books
they were known as seers and they were held in fear by women and the elderly
they rode for the entire day
well interpret the dream he said
a lot of patience but shepherds know all about patience
we are part of that soul so we rarely recognize that it is working for us
the world speaks many languages the boy thought
the old man wore a breastplate of gold and he knew about my past
well then we've got a problem
but the englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it
before long maybe in just a few days he would be at the pyramids
the merchant was silent for a few moments
their faces were hidden behind blue veils with only their eyes showing
i don't know why
without such love one's dreams would have no meaning
i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
love is the force that transforms and improves the soul of the world
strange images passed through my mind
they called that discovery the master work ‚äî it was part liquid and part solid
that's why i feel that i deserve a part of what you find
all who went there were happy at having done so
and they had understood each other perfectly well
they spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didn't understand any of it
not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view
but the boy couldn't even speak
and you ought to read more about the world answered the englishman
i'm coming fatima he said
the area was swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view
from atop its walls one can catch a glimpse of africa
the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
he appeared with the first stars of evening
it's too bad that he's quickly going to forget my name he thought
we'll leave tomorrow before sunrise was the alchemist's only response
the boy wanted to take her hand
servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea
he must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves
yet it was a little too large for assurance
i have the money i need to buy my sheep
the people were also praying to heaven for protection
and you've told me nothing along the way said the boy
he seemed unfriendly and had looked irritated when the boy had entered
he knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in
if i'm on the march i just concentrate on marching
i'm a desert woman and i'm proud of that
as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
but none of that is from the pyramids said the alchemist
they both spoke the same language
then he turned to the boy
and the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have
the boy offered his bottle hoping that the old man would leave him alone
and it knew nothing about love
the boy didn't say anything
and for wise men gold is the metal that evolved the furthest
but those who know about such things would know that those are urim and thummim
it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
i have already found my treasure
i myself heard nothing of that
a friend had told the boy about the shop and he had taken his sheep there
but he had found a guide and didn't want to miss out on an opportunity
the boy was becoming nervous
you old sorcerer the boy shouted up to the sky
an old man with a breastplate of gold wouldn't have lied just to acquire six sheep
but i'd like to see the castles in the towns where they live the boy explained
but now i'm sad and alone
i only interpret dreams
can i get a woot woot
go back to watching the caravan he said
he fell asleep and when he awoke the sun was already high
it's the emerald tablet said the englishman proud that he might teach something to the boy
you have told me about your dreams about the old king and your treasure
it was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the master work
it's true life really is generous to those who pursue their destiny the boy thought
everything in life is an omen said the englishman now closing the journal he was reading
and in that way the months passed
he walked slowly through the market
he regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert
the old man knew how to read and had already read the book
he paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year
the alchemist is two hundred years old the englishman had told him
every search begins with beginner's luck
the boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure
the alchemist lighted the fire and soon a delicious aroma filled the tent
always heed the omens the old king had said
you are wise because you observe everything from a distance the boy said
soak the cloth and drown the sharp odor
fly by night and you waste little time
you know what i want
he sent the boy on a short errand

we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
suddenly the monster disappeared
we broke it in half
as he was leaving he saw in the corner of the room his old shepherd's pouch
i'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back
what are these things he asked
he needs three days answered the alchemist
when he was a child that man wanted to travel too
and he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes
he tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the desert and its stones
but bakers are more important people than shepherds
no that's not what i mean
maktub thought the boy
they called that discovery the master work ‚äî it was part liquid and part solid
the crow tilted its head as if it was thinking
apologies for not calling you back
upon returning to the wise man he related in detail everything he had seen
i've never had one before the merchant answered
their faces were hidden behind blue veils with only their eyes showing
never mind what desk
the englishman asked if they were in danger
all the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared
there's a bunch of autograph seekers out front
not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view
it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds

we were all made by the same hand and we have the same soul
that makes sense the alchemist answered
the ingenious physicist rubbed his nose and scratched his chin

ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
throughout the entire day we will be on the lookout for our enemies
that's true enough the boy thought ruefully
the englishman could not contain his excitement
i'm looking for a treasure said the boy and he immediately regretted having said it
it's what you have always wanted to accomplish
he suddenly felt tremendously happy
i've been at it for over two years and i'm still discovering new ideas
i've already told you
so he began to wander through the city and found himself at the gates
i can work for the rest of today the boy answered
the old woman had said the same thing
then she filled her vessel with water and left
if i don't find it i can always go home
the battles may last for a long time perhaps even years
and continue to pay heed to the omens
you bet your bottom dollar we would

there was very little talking
and don't forget the language of omens
he didn't know the man yet but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared

in those times the master work could be written simply on an emerald
the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
if i had told you you wouldn't have seen the pyramids
but i'd like to see the castles in the towns where they live the boy explained
they crossed the desert for another two days in silence
without responding the guard entered the tent where he remained for some time
the top had certainly ceased to rotate
be careful with your prognostications said the stranger
your eyes show the strength of your soul answered the alchemist
how do people celebrate good weather over there
why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
it sounded like a gypsy prayer
even from a distance their eyes conveyed the strength of their souls
he only lost three buttons off his vest
i'm not afraid of failing
help me the boy said

the boy waited and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted
but where are the houses
he became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him
that he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen
i have known true alchemists the alchemist continued
because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert the boy said
why don't you fellows get your own news
but before i go i want to tell you a little story
you like every boy
now i can see that it hasn't been too bad
everything has been written by the same hand
given only the public key it is very hard to compute the private one
however the authors ignore a very large body of work on tone mapping
crossing your own pals
he watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind
just teach me to be the wind for a few moments the boy said
but there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing mint tea
well why don't you go to mecca now asked the boy
toward the end of the afternoon they came upon a coptic monastery
and he vanished around the corner of the plaza
the shepherd said nothing
don't trust the smiling penguin
strange images passed through my mind
it's not easy to find the philosopher's stone said the englishman
the boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert
he was already re accustomed to desert's silence
and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
but in his heart he knew that it did matter
it was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted
he was more confident in himself though and felt as though he could conquer the world
his speech ended in standing ovations
they went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to set
i didn't need to waste my time just for this he said
but the boy couldn't even speak
the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
i'm a woman of the desert she said averting her face
but if you have to go before then go on in pursuit of your dream
we've run out of petrol and diesel
a card hanging in the doorway announced that several languages were spoken in the shop
they made the boy continue digging but he found nothing
have you ever tried
it's called the principle of favorability beginner's luck
i'm going to guide you across the desert the alchemist said
is sheriff helen in there

the stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about
younger man what he had seen and the man asked him to wait there
lots of places sell tea around here the merchant said
you don't deny that
everywhere there were stalls with items for sale
it was the pure language of the world
the boy watched the exchange with fascination
the englishman was disappointed
and tomorrow his enemy would also be a part of that soul
was the doctor here
i took planks of birch wood and crafted a bookshelf
let me tell you what will happen
so he asked if the old man's blessing was still with him
it's the name of the prophet's daughter fatima said
and better still to be alone with one's books
so what is salem like he asked trying to get some sort of clue
he wants me to write down only things that i think about but not things i plan to do
they were both silent for a time observing the plaza and the townspeople
they jetted off to the bahamas
the boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day
i don‚äôt mind working from home most of the time but i do miss having coworkers
did you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create
let's the alchemist answered
the boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous day
somewhere you are holding the person i love the boy said
almost everyone here speaks spanish
he put his headcloth in place and secured it with a ring made of camel skin
one is loved because one is loved
mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies
you already know about alchemy
no the alchemist answered
there has been a robbery at the burger shop in downtown
the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
i'm doing much better and soon you'll be able to return to your sheep
to do that successfully i must have no fear of failure
they didn't have the printing press in those days the boy argued
don't be impatient he repeated to himself
well interpret the dream he said
i'm an old superstitious arab and i believe in our proverbs
because you will never again be able to keep it quiet
and then they want the person to change
not with my money
and then there were the others who were interested only in gold
he wandered for a while keeping the date palms of the oasis within sight
he must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert
i couldn‚äôt stop staring at it
but the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept
i got doctor bills to pay
that isn't what i got married for
i promised that i would make my own decisions he said to himself
the boy awoke before dawn
three armed tribesmen approached and asked what the boy and the alchemist were doing there
to my satisfaction i have been mentioned in the credits for my proficiency
the camel driver understood what the boy was saying
he transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to the miner's foot
at least we've finally got something we can celebrate
it spoke of journeys discoveries books and change
i don't know the desert that well yet
but none of that is from the pyramids said the alchemist
it required no explanation just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time
because we're the people and we're tough
but he had to move on
but she said nothing
you must love the desert but never trust it completely
the weather in finland sucks
to be continued
suddenly he disappeared and i could hear a faint shriek behind the walls
there was no other baggage
he was alarmed by what had happened
in any case the desert was impassable
sit down and let me treat you to something said the boy
from there he could see africa in the distance
i want to do something big and something important
in a way so am i he said
this is what was written on the emerald tablet said the alchemist when he had finished
they blow across the world without a birthplace and with no place to die
but he kept quiet because he had heard what the alchemist said to the monk
the boy said nothing

the wharf could be seen at the farther shore
air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
you must love the desert but never trust it completely
as they sat down at the only table in the place the crystal merchant laughed
what do you know about it
it was flowering beautifully
the alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery
then it was the radio
there is a social facility on the other side of the road
don't say those things
i know you're anxious to make a train
and in that way the months passed
neighbors moved away and there remained only a few small shops on the hill
the police finally manage to get him out of the park
he drew on the back of his jacket with a blue fountain pen
the alchemist followed as the boy's horse ran for almost half an hour
he asked it please never to stop speaking to him
i can smell it

as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
we have also started contemplating the possibility of moving back to colorado
and seizing the boy's bag the alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief
i found myself alone and saw the people on the other side of the pit running away
the man looked at the angel in surprise
the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
as the englishman left fatima arrived and filled her vessel with water
he thought that with some patience he'd be able to transform everything into gold
suddenly a huge quantity of green smoke came out of the pit in three puffs and went straight into the still air
death doesn't change anything the boy thought
don't be impatient he repeated to himself
finally after hours of waiting the guard bade the boy enter
earlier this year we found a really nice place near my office and we moved in together
he tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the desert and its stones
finally a young woman approached who was not dressed in black
the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
because i've always heard about them the boy answered saying nothing about his dream
that's what alchemists do
he doesn't have anything else
looking at the sun he calculated that he would reach tarifa before midday
but before i go i want to tell you a little story
just teach me to be the wind for a few moments the boy said
he remembered something his grandfather had once told him that butterflies were a good omen
i'm hunting with my falcon the alchemist answered
he had been so far away that his face wasn't even visible
i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
they ate in silence
and also because i know about the soul of the world he thought to himself

when i had my sheep i was happy and i made those around me happy
so he asked if the old man's blessing was still with him
it's almost as if he had been here and left his mark he thought
i was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about what it's like to live and work there
the day was hot and the wine was refreshing
i don‚äôt mind working from home most of the time but i do miss having coworkers
there is only one way to learn the alchemist answered
i'll work all night until dawn and i'll clean every piece of crystal in your shop
we are obliged at least once in our lives to visit the holy city of mecca
but those who know about such things would know that those are urim and thummim
yes that's what love is
'everyone loved them and enjoyed them
i know its dimensions and how it behaves
the englishman's eyes lit up
he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
he had already seen many people come and go and the desert remained as it was
no one seemed to have thought about it that night
but none of that mattered to the alchemist
the boy accustomed to recognizing omens spoke to the merchant
it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
but you don't know about love
the arab accepted them without a word
he tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the desert and its stones
then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments looking at the sword
he could sell the stones and buy a return ticket
remember that wherever your heart is there you will find your treasure
it's not often that money can save someone's life
it sounded like a gypsy prayer
he carried two dead hawks over his shoulder
the land was ruined and i had to find some other way to earn a living
he knelt down to find urim and thummim and put them back in the pouch
henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
the streamer of gas came out towards us
the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
some storms are worth the wreckage
we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
now leave us alone said the boy to the young arab
so how will we name all these hurricanes
he said that everything has its own destiny
you have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels
the shepherd said nothing
he walked slowly through the market
many telescopes were pointed at it
there is only one way to learn the alchemist answered
there's life here the boy said to the alchemist
for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
the steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon
the alchemist removed the pan from the fire and set it aside to cool
they called it the simum and it was worse than a storm at sea
he loosened the reins on his horse who galloped forward over the rocks and sand
he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
maybe she didn't even remember him
the boy offered his bottle hoping that the old man would leave him alone
but most important he was able every day to live out his dream
that's what alchemists do
arabs often appeared in the city shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day
but now i'm sad and alone
i can learn something from the desert too
all who went there were happy at having done so
it's easy and yet i've never done it before he thought
it reminded him of the wool from his sheep
all i saw was an army said the boy
maybe we're all that way the boy mused
he sat on a stone and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon
bravery is the ability to overcome fear
just for the first year
two physicists pondered their revised quantum field theory together
what did you say

they were spaced out in rows three feet apart
long live the king
what the eye doesn't see the heart doesn't grieve over
of course the two were unable to do anything
i'm going to go back to doing just what i did before the boy thought
even though the sheep didn't teach me to speak arabic
it's not easy to find the philosopher's stone said the englishman
you and i aren't like hassan that rich merchant
there was a murmur from the crowd
i don't like people to do that because the sheep are afraid of strangers
he still had some doubts about the decision he had made
the boy watched the exchange with fascination
do you have isabella's phone number
something's happened to everybody
they begin creeping up on you trying to sell you something
nine men were hired to dig the ruins
it led to a large exodus of the city with a majority of the population leaving

what could it be
i could not judge for her actions but i believe that she is right
oh i think you are right
how could i help it

do you still remember your old account's password
first of all i am introducing the facilitators of this science camp
this is for you he said holding one of the parts out to the monk
people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
the englishman didn't answer him directly
the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
it's not easy to find the philosopher's stone said the englishman
i don't like people to do that because the sheep are afraid of strangers
his soul must be too primitive to understand those things he thought
it was a bundle of money
it was more activity than usual for this time of the morning
it's almost as if he had been here and left his mark he thought
if what one finds is made of pure matter it will never spoil
he had come to the town only to find a woman who could interpret his dream
this is for the boy
so what should i do now the boy asked
but they could never have taught him arabic
came to the bar he had entered on his first day there
the boy closed his book
he followed the movement of the birds trying to read something into it
what are they doing the old man asked pointing at the people in the plaza
that's the way it always is said the old man
the tube was blown and the tire flat and useless
it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
and that he a boy could perform miracles
at the same time people were passing my shop all the time heading for mecca
but you will love her and she'll return your love
i'd like to build a display case for the crystal the boy said to the merchant
what was written on the emerald tablet the boy wanted to know
because of the omens the alchemist answered
his new friend pushed the owner aside and pulled the boy outside with him
it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
he thought that with some patience he'd be able to transform everything into gold
so the boy was disappointed he decided that he would never again believe in dreams
and what do you do in salem he insisted
he felt uneasy at the man's presence
where the sand was more substantial
their faces were covered with the blue cloths and their eyes showed fear
then he sat in the sun filled doorway smoking the hookah
the alchemist probably already knew all that
the two walked out among the palms
but then he stopped
throughout the night the boy dug at the place he had chosen but found nothing
but that's why you created the game in the first place the boy answered
the boy was getting irritated
he just got a new kite for his birthday
so you know about love the boy said
and he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved
but as he saw them lying there on the ground another phrase came to his mind
i didn't know shepherds knew how to read said a girl's voice behind him
yes or even search for treasure
i don't know the desert that well yet
i'm going to wait here for you every day
you'll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants
i'm a desert woman and i'm proud of that
the boy leapt as well but away from the alchemist
but the boy never took his eye off his new friend
i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
before him was an enormous white horse rearing over him with a frightening scream
the boy was relieved
i'll be back the boy said
the sea has lived on in this shell because that's its destiny
it's not a battle of good against evil
then she again took his hands and studied them carefully
i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
so how will we name all these hurricanes
what he said reminded the boy of the old king
i thought that everything i owned would be destroyed
at his side was the young arab the boy had spoken with earlier
the alchemists spent years in their laboratories observing the fire that purified the metals
a boy came running towards me
how did you learn to read the girl asked at one point
there's one that says 'everything that happens once can never happen again
two days later the merchant spoke to the boy about the display
he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
so he asked if the old man's blessing was still with him
the immense collection of people and animals began to travel faster
at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
he stuck his hand into the pouch and felt around for one of the stones
as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
they went in to drink the tea which was served in beautiful crystal glasses
it was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden
i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
it was the first time she had done that
we know what you're up to
they had a lot to divulge
the tree top waved in a graceful way
it's a shame that soliloquies are no longer a large part of modern literature
let's toss a coin
it is very important that you remember
she flaps her cape as she parades the street
but as time passed tangier had changed
but the englishman was exultant
you have to cross the entire sahara desert said the young man
my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
the boy leapt as well but away from the alchemist
what kind of blow should one deliver next in order to remain alive
all the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared
fatima is a woman of the desert said the alchemist
their faces were hidden behind blue veils with only their eyes showing
the boy brought his horse closer
he remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn't even have yet
to continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon fatima
i need it to get to the pyramids he said
he knew how to shear them and how to slaughter them
so when i look out over your sands i am also looking at her
does a man's heart always help him the boy asked the alchemist
the animals were exhausted and the men talked among themselves less and less
you and i aren't like hassan that rich merchant
before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
but he certainly didn't desire that an army invade the oasis
there was enough there to buy a lot of weapons
one is loved because one is loved
if he makes a buying mistake it doesn't affect him much
and yet none of these people has ever met the old king
the boy looked out at the horizon
it's like the camel driver said 'eat when it's time to eat
i want to stay at the oasis the boy answered
you gave them everything i had the boy said
on the seventh day the alchemist decided to make camp earlier than usual
i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy
they have gotten used to my being away and so have i
the boy began to dig into the dune
it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
let's stop this another commander said
among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
but he had to move on
these are the spies said one of the men
it was there that the wise man lived
the alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy's cup
they are so used to me that they know my schedule he muttered
i'm the king of salem the old man had said
he almost began to tell about his treasure but decided not to do so
but they were not there
the alchemists spent years in their laboratories observing the fire that purified the metals
this man looked exactly the same except that now the roles were reversed
another trick the boy thought
but the boy couldn't even speak
life attracts life the alchemist answered
he took out his money and counted it
the boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch
when you are loved you can do anything in creation
it was the first time either had touched the other
henderson was taking it in
henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
whenever he could he sought out a new road to travel
i'm a desert woman and i'm proud of that
finally after hours of waiting the guard bade the boy enter
listen to your heart
but the boy was quiet
it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
he followed the movement of the birds trying to read something into it
he knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in
if i don't find it i can always go home
and finally the falcon returned with their meal
it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
the boy was surprised
the englishman was disappointed
why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument
he wanted to say so to the alchemist but he was afraid of the man
he dressed in his arabian clothing of white linen bought especially for this day
the boy fell to the sand nearly unconscious
but the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom
the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
i was impatient to see it opened
strange images passed through my mind
in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
then suddenly he noticed it with a start
henderson was taking it in
the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
some storms are worth the wreckage
some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
it had a diameter of about thirty yards
i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
and he wasn't faring much better
i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
but now the sounds inside had stopped
it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
she was silent for a moment
the lumberjack jumped up the tree
farmers came in to thresh the oat crop
jane spoke emphatically
nine rows of soldiers stood in a line
they floated on the raft to sun their white backs
how did it end
cars and busses stalled in snow drifts
the cringe levels were almost unbearable
cut the pie into large parts
the homeless seem to like soup
the cement had dried when he moved it
the couch cover and hall drapes were blue
find a picture older than five weeks

will you put that thing away
you bet i will
we'll have to satisfy them
tortoises are reptiles not amphibians
but it is not a class that was requested by our alumni or prospective students
i just came in to get warm
she told me to write a play for tonight
we've got something a whole lot bigger than that
you haven't seen anything yet
there are two basic approaches to dictating code using custom grammars or using voicecode
the money is unimportant
what's the matter with everybody
a poor little fellow that never meant nobody no harm
she doesn't know it yet
i just got an e mail from my crush
you can't bribe me
you may not have a great deal of time
we need to run
it was like electricity through her veins
please don't be lazy
the ladder of the fire truck was not long enough
that's got nothing to do with it
she sends for you
what's done is done
and here's a kiss for you
why didn't you ask neal about it
since then i haven't been able to get another one
ten minutes ago i had a job
there is a dentist and some other doctors inside this clinic
the accommodation was affordable and cosy
i've just guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs
you can do a lot just using your voice but there are still a few times you'll find yourself reaching for a mouse
and that other honeymoon in a coal mine
to accelerate progress towards this new world of end to end open source hands free coding
between roast beef and potatoes how can we lose
hold your nose to keep the smell from disabling your motor functions
what are you afraid of melissa
give me some carrots and other vegetables i'm going to feed the rabbits
what did you come here for
the grass was peppered with daisies
and you ought to read more about the world answered the englishman
they continued across the desert
toward the end of the afternoon they came upon a coptic monastery
you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
that night he told all of this to the alchemist
i have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time
with every day that passed the boy's heart became more and more silent
always heed the omens the old king had said
it was better than the scent of the hookahs
that day he didn't make a cast
but don't worry the alchemist continued
no he heard a voice on the wind say
and the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable
i am proud of you he said
the streamer of gas came out towards us
the englishman's eyes lit up
so it's better to listen to what it has to say
his heart was heavy and he had been melancholy since the previous night
i don't know the desert that well yet
hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
the boy was surprised and then irritated
it's called the principle of favorability
imagine if everyone went around transforming lead into gold
it was the pure language of the world
camels are traitorous they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire
the meeting was over
the boy knew the desert sensed his fear
because the crystal was dirty
wearing his new sandals he descended the stairs silently
it had a diameter of about thirty yards
at the first glance it was really not very exciting
i have to find a man who knows that universal language
he arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept
meanwhile the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation
he won't leave the circle
and one can always come back
almost everyone here speaks spanish
but finally the merchant appeared and asked the boy to shear four sheep
vibrations of peace throughout the tent
she knows that men have to go away in order to return
so then try he said to the englishman
at the camp it was difficult to see anything
and their eyes spoke of death
he thought of all the married shepherds he had known
few people realise the immensity of vacancy
the war continued and at times the wind carried the sweet sickly smell of blood
it helped me to trust in people the englishman answered
but fatima's hands held to the handles of her jug
three armed tribesmen approached and asked what the boy and the alchemist were doing there
he told fatima that at their next meeting
when the pan had cooled the monk and the boy looked at it dazzled
the tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do
i'm going into the desert the man answered turning back to his reading
let's the alchemist answered
hunches his mother used to call them
the boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert
don't give in to your fears said the alchemist in a strangely gentle voice
the boy remembered an old proverb from his country
this is what was written on the emerald tablet said the alchemist when he had finished
there was very little talking
here i am between my flock and my treasure the boy thought
when you play cards the first time you are almost sure to win
but he still couldn't flee
maktub the boy said remembering the crystal merchant
but use them to buy your flock
what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
but you don't know about love
everywhere there were stalls with items for sale
i want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes
he condemned the commander to death without honor
it didn't bring with it the smell of the desert nor the threat of moorish invasion
the boy was relieved
when you play cards the first time you are almost sure to win
remember that wherever your heart is there you will find your treasure
the merchants were assembling their stalls and the boy helped a candy seller to do his
there was a time when for me a camel's whinnying was nothing more than whinnying
there was no need to imprison them the arabs simply confiscated their horses
i don't think i know that one
yesterday i waited forever for the subway train
they never found the secret
they also began to feel that they knew a better way than others had
because you are trying to realize your destiny
everything has been written by the same hand
the alchemist's words echoed out like a curse
but now i'm sad and alone
as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
he had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist
and continue to pay heed to the omens
and eventually man will nourish your sands where the game will once again flourish
it was the first time she had done that
i'm not afraid of any newspapers
the stranger withdrew the sword from the boy's forehead and the boy felt immensely relieved
i saw astonishment and horror on the faces of the people around me
i still have no idea how to turn myself into the wind the boy repeated
they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
and he told what he had seen
it seems old and wise
he needs three days answered the alchemist
i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
you ought to stay over
congressman aaron is here to see you
i'm going to live a normal life and have a home
she and heather were talking
did she guarantee this place
i don't know you from adam
got a lot of charm
what's that got to do with it
everybody wait a minute
reality was permanently scarred from those force field experiments
let us in on it
you get somebody else to wash the diapers
you weren't here to build them

what are they like
he who won't be advised can't be helped
i understand he said
what does she look like
sooner or later three brothers three castles
what could he do
the cheese was delicious especially when accompanied by the delicious crusty bread
in the discotheque the dj played progressive house music and trance
just by looking at them
i'm going to wait here for you every day
he had surprised himself with the thought
why do they make things so complicated he asked the englishman one night
one afternoon they passed by the encampment of one of the tribes
but i'm going to egypt the boy said
his new friend pushed the owner aside and pulled the boy outside with him
but that's why you created the game in the first place the boy answered
but he certainly didn't desire that an army invade the oasis
the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
i want you to be my wife
he condemned the commander to death without honor
they were people of the desert and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities
alchemy is a serious discipline
that it was unable to deal with this boy who spoke the language of the world
the same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip
tell me more about your dream said the woman
if a person is living out his destiny he knows everything he needs to know
the people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses
the wind began to pick up
he regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert
i should have repeated it for him
i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
people talk a lot about omens thought the shepherd
they provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes
he suddenly felt tremendously happy
they went in to drink the tea which was served in beautiful crystal glasses
at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
we're going to shoot the works
a long note was sounded on a bugle and everyone mounted up
that's a good idea
i think they're going to last for a long time he said to the monk
the caravan moved toward the east
i can learn something from the desert too
that first day everyone slept from exhaustion including the englishman
without such love one's dreams would have no meaning
because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert the boy said
the alchemist stopped abruptly and bent to the ground
it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
when you play cards the first time you are almost sure to win
the wind told me that you know about love the boy said to the sun
for every ten dead men among our enemies you will receive a piece of gold
he transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to the miner's foot
don't try to enter into the life of the oasis
but finally the merchant appeared and asked the boy to shear four sheep
all this happened between sunrise and sunset the boy thought
the tradition teaches men how to cross the desert and how their children should marry
if what one finds is made of pure matter it will never spoil
if you have to wait until the war is over then wait
and because the tribes declared war i went to the well seeking the alchemist
he needs three days answered the alchemist
and one or two persons were returning
it was the first time either had touched the other
the gods should not have desires because they don't have destinies
you dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them he said
but as time passed tangier had changed
but you will love her and she'll return your love
he ran his fingers slowly over the stones sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces
he really was a king
they were relieved and happy
let's get out of here said the new arrival
this is for the boy
dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church
he waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop
i was impatient to see it opened
there are powerful forces on both sides and the war is important to both armies
i didn't mean to shoot him
he was excited and at the same time uneasy maybe the girl had already forgotten him
the woman was silent for some time
but he had found a guide and didn't want to miss out on an opportunity
treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly
the sheep will get used to my not being there too the boy thought
they mounted their horses and rode out in the direction of the pyramids of egypt
the tea seemed less bitter
wearing his new sandals he descended the stairs silently
the boy had noticed that the englishman was irritable and missed his books
i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
in a way so am i he said
if i don't find it i can always go home
he tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the desert and its stones
the first day passed
go and speak to the tribal chieftains said the camel driver
well i'd like to see their land and see how they live said his son
they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
i only interpret dreams
well usually i learn more from my sheep than from books he answered
this is what was written on the emerald tablet said the alchemist when he had finished
the battles may last for a long time perhaps even years
always ask an objective question
who told you that asked the boy startled
he was already re accustomed to desert's silence
he felt uneasy at the man's presence
he told fatima that at their next meeting
who is it from
the wind's curiosity was aroused something that had never happened before
and then the boy understood
how about driving me home in style
want me to hang paintings at their convenience
the boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert
i'm not afraid of failing
the monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters
the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
the boy leapt as well but away from the alchemist
wait for the end of the war
melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port
one night the father had a dream
air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
my friend bought all the other sheep immediately
i heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist the wind said
one is loved because one is loved
when you are loved you can do anything in creation
you brought a new feeling into my crystal shop
why did you want to see me the boy asked
for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
maktub the boy said remembering the crystal merchant
i'm an alchemist simply because i'm an alchemist he said as he prepared the meal
do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked
the view had better be worth it
two more months passed and the shelf brought many customers into the crystal shop
it looked like a rusty gas float
the sheep had taught him that
the old man opened his cape and the boy was struck by what he saw
having heard that the boy became even more interested in alchemy
he was more certain of it than of anything in the world
some went away while i was there and other people came
the sweet corn tasted better grilled
well then we've got a problem
they met each other via online video messaging
and he immediately felt peace in his heart
just handling them made him feel better
you gave them everything i had the boy said
some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
how was that for a tight squeeze
get that ladder up here
business has really improved he said to the boy after the customer had left
neighbors moved away and there remained only a few small shops on the hill
where is the treasure he asked
henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
so then try he said to the englishman
even from a distance their eyes conveyed the strength of their souls
we'll just start by impounding the post property
it said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn
their faces were hidden behind blue veils with only their eyes showing
they ate in silence
this is the first phase of the job he said
but there was something there in his heart that wouldn't allow him to do so
and for wise men gold is the metal that evolved the furthest
ellie won first prize in the spelling competition
replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
in any case the desert was impassable
the same book that taught me about urim and thummim
we're refugees from the tribal wars and we need money the other figure said
the two walked out among the palms
he had suddenly remembered that in tarifa there was an old woman who interpreted dreams
it took him a while to get to the office
but the boy never took his eye off his new friend
he stuck his hand into the pouch and felt around for one of the stones
at that point in their lives everything is clear and everything is possible
there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
the steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon
the boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question
they spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didn't understand any of it
two days later the merchant spoke to the boy about the display
but the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept
that's the magic of omens said the boy
but one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the hole
that's the principle that governs all things he said
i started to run like crazy and made for the first group of trees
it's easy and yet i've never done it before he thought
from then on the boy understood his heart
and the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable
servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea
what kind of blow should one deliver next in order to remain alive
before long maybe in just a few days he would be at the pyramids
but the englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it
our merchants bought that man and brought him to egypt
i'll bet it's a warrant for my arrest
the boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across the desert
it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
i noticed that the boy answered
three days from now he would be with the merchant's daughter
you would have to have been born an arab to understand he answered
i learned how to care for sheep and i haven't forgotten how that's done
there was very little talking
the caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis
i'm interested only in the present
something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
aren't you allowed to kiss back
and they found the watch on him
in order to find the treasure you will have to follow the omens
relaxed and unhurried he resolved that he would walk through the narrow streets of tangier
they called that discovery the master work ‚äî it was part liquid and part solid
it's called the principle of favorability
the horse reared again raising a cloud of dust
without responding the guard entered the tent where he remained for some time
it was a bundle of money
there's no danger the boy said when they had moved on past the encampment
he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep
the caravan began to travel day and night
we don't know when the war will end so we can't continue our journey he said
finally a young woman approached who was not dressed in black
but then he stopped
if good things are coming they will be a pleasant surprise said the seer
my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
maybe she didn't even remember him
the boy looked around him at the date palms
and your camels will bring you wealth and power
he rose and made his way back toward the palm trees
and don't forget the language of omens
love required them to stay with the people they loved
but bakers are more important people than shepherds
after all what he had always wanted was just that to know new places
but she said nothing
i told him that was what i had come here to learn
he had already seen many people come and go and the desert remained as it was
why did you want to see me the boy asked
but he kept the sword in his hand
first they tried to find him on their own
he saw that fatima's eyes were filled with tears
when you are loved you can do anything in creation
i learned the alchemist's secrets in my travels
i want to stay at the oasis the boy answered
the caravan began to travel day and night
and they had understood each other perfectly well
but the boy was quiet
it doesn't matter he said to his sheep
will you give me your blessing asked the boy
so he began to wander through the city and found himself at the gates
he thought of all the married shepherds he had known
so you know about love the boy said
rest well tonight as if you were a warrior preparing for combat
as they sat down at the only table in the place the crystal merchant laughed
you dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them he said
then you taught me something of the universal language and the soul of the world
it was a strange furnace fueled by firewood with a transparent flask heating on top
when he reached the top of the dune his heart leapt
everyone when they are young knows what their destiny is
as he looked at the stones he felt relieved for some reason
and that's where the power of love comes in
i'm interested only in the present
the englishman asked if they were in danger
the boy approached her to ask about the alchemist
he called to the boy and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment
throughout the entire day we will be on the lookout for our enemies
and ask for a glass of wine for me
he felt uneasy at the man's presence
from then on the boy understood his heart
the city was still sleeping
what is it you wish to know
thou comest'well if thou comest alone said of misfortunes
the c plus plus framework qt is pronounced like cute
in retrospect everything was already decided when we heard the siren
look you really need to sort yourself out
give me my robe
they raised their glasses in the old bar
but it sounds like it won't be fixed until the consumer version which doesn't have a release date yet
you won't miss anything
and that's another thing
i know what you're feeling
spain is producing lots of lettuce paprika and tomatoes
and you can quote me on that

hello kitty is actually a girl not a cat
i'll always remember it
before reading this post please familiarize yourself with my getting started guide and how to move around a file quickly
they drank their milk and fell asleep
if you make improvements please send me pull requests
the boy awoke before dawn
in some places the ground was covered with the salt of dried up lakes
they called it the simum and it was worse than a storm at sea
looking up he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky
the dunes are changed by the wind but the desert never changes
before long maybe in just a few days he would be at the pyramids
but as time passed tangier had changed
well why don't we go there right now the boy asked
they were both silent for a time observing the plaza and the townspeople
so he began to wander through the city and found himself at the gates
maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership
suddenly a huge quantity of green smoke came out of the pit in three puffs and went straight into the still air
his new friend pushed the owner aside and pulled the boy outside with him
to do that successfully i must have no fear of failure
what does it all mean
what could it be
who is the blonde girl with the red skirt
but what if all our readers were whispering
darling i have a gift for you
she expects that her birthday cake should be pink not purple
remember remember the fifth of november

thanks ever so much for the bag

how long is it

sooner or later they'll find out how to read these hieroglyphics
my wife had a baby last week
the runway seems way to short for this type of plane

looking up he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky
at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
he really was a king a wise king
that day he didn't make a cast
the old man knew how to read and had already read the book
i've never had one before the merchant answered
i want you to help me turn myself into the wind the boy answered
the first day passed
servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea
it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
but most important he was able every day to live out his dream
he appeared with the first stars of evening
that's the man who knows all the secrets of the world she said
two years ago right here on this spot i had a recurrent dream too
they provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes
and eventually man will nourish your sands where the game will once again flourish
no the alchemist answered
and the alchemist understood that the boy's heart had returned to the soul of the world
but then he remembered that he wasn't going to have to pay anything
and he told what he had seen
he got up adjusted his clothing and picked up his pouch
and she already has her treasure it's you
the woman was silent for some time
it has happened many times before
most of them were staring quietly at the big table
and seizing the boy's bag the alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief
now leave us alone said the boy to the young arab
i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy
i've had this shop for thirty years
his speech ended in standing ovations
underneath the ground was a world unknown to any human
i'm addicted to recycling
what are you doing on this fine day
you're a man disgusted with all of civilization
he was a wealthy man
nice to meet you
those are the rules of war the leader explained
my friend bought all the other sheep immediately
the boy was relieved
i couldn‚äôt stop staring at it
he wasn't an alchemist
everything in life is an omen said the englishman now closing the journal he was reading
the secret is here in the present
no one said a word as the old man continued
then she again took his hands and studied them carefully
it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
he picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch
fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent
now i too will be one of the women who wait
the englishman's eyes lit up
the boy thought of fatima
but he certainly didn't desire that an army invade the oasis
two more months passed and the shelf brought many customers into the crystal shop
whenever he saw the sea or a fire he fell silent impressed by their elemental force
and you ought to read more about the world answered the englishman
the alchemists spent years in their laboratories observing the fire that purified the metals
from where he sat he could observe the plaza
and to do that you need money
the boy smiled and continued digging
in his heart he wanted to remain awake but he also wanted to sleep
the old man knew how to read and had already read the book
but the boy was quiet
this is why alchemy exists the boy said
there was a small building there with a window at which people bought tickets to africa
let's go and have some lunch said the crystal merchant
but those who know about such things would know that those are urim and thummim
i'm not going very far the alchemist answered looking straight into the eyes of the horsemen
the boy thanked him ate it and went on his way
a breeze began to blow
because you have already lost your savings twice
they both spoke the same language
they called that discovery the master work ‚äî it was part liquid and part solid
then the thing came upon him in a flash
it was a cobra whose venom could kill a person in minutes
why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument
a while ago i rode through the desert with a man who had books on alchemy
the boy thought about the crystal merchant
maybe that's why they always stay close to me
he was older and was carrying a small bucket
that's the point at which most people give up
but most important he was able every day to live out his dream
then suddenly he noticed it with a start
some do come back
wearing his new sandals he descended the stairs silently
had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
to show you one of life's simple lessons the alchemist answered
i thought that someday i'd be rich and could go to mecca
the boy was surprised
why do they make things so complicated he asked the englishman one night
it was a tent like many at the oasis
remember that wherever your heart is there you will find your treasure
it was a bundle of money
the boy watched the exchange with fascination
most of them were staring quietly at the big table
at his side was the young arab the boy had spoken with earlier
i know good crystal from bad and everything else there is to know about crystal
that it was unable to deal with this boy who spoke the language of the world
he took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young man
i have to separate out the sulfur
and look how many things the wind already knew how to do
and it knew nothing about love
treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly
there were just drawings coded instructions and obscure texts
you could have died after peace had been declared
the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
your eyes show the strength of your soul answered the alchemist
the old man looked disappointed
the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
i was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about what it's like to live and work there
and it's not love to see everything from a distance like you do
the englishman asked if they were in danger
i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
the treasure is at the pyramids that you already knew
and ask for a glass of wine for me
it was the levanter the wind that came from africa
an hour later he had before him a chest of spanish gold coins
the boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across the desert
but the alchemist continued to look to the horizon
people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
the omens had been true after all
he knew what i was thinking the boy said to himself
but when the reign of tiberius ended his poems were forgotten
now his intuition was that he had been right in coming
of course the two were unable to do anything
go and speak to the tribal chieftains said the camel driver
they were given to me as a present by a king the boy said
and continue to pay heed to the omens
they seemed to laugh at him and he laughed back his heart bursting with joy
i just know that the tradition is always right
he put his headcloth in place and secured it with a ring made of camel skin

he remembered the sword
his father said no more
and he gave the boy his blessing

the boy didn't know what to say

among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
but the tradition also says that we should believe the messages of the desert

the same book that taught me about urim and thummim
before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
that he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen
the following night the boy appeared at the alchemist's tent with a horse
he called to the boy and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment
why did you want to see me the boy asked
but he didn't stop
the closer he got to the realization of his dream the more difficult things became
the monk was irritated
he suddenly felt tremendously happy
he decided to spend the night there
i want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes
he had been to the village only once the year before
no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
looking up he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky
and the girl pointed to the south indicating that it was there the strange man lived
the horizon was tinged with red and suddenly the sun appeared
he wanted to forget about the vision and return to his meditation
it was the pure language of the world
then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments looking at the sword
but the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept
they're not concerned with that right now
imagine if everyone went around transforming lead into gold

then suddenly he noticed it with a start
now his intuition was that he had been right in coming
you'll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants
they become a part of everything
the desert didn't answer him for a few moments
i'm not going very far the alchemist answered looking straight into the eyes of the horsemen
he was planning as he left the bar
what he said reminded the boy of the old king
in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
the alchemist followed as the boy's horse ran for almost half an hour
it was the pure language of the world
so we their hearts speak more and more softly
now leave us alone said the boy to the young arab
on the second day the boy climbed to the top of a cliff near the camp
if a person is living out his destiny he knows everything he needs to know
coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
the englishman prodded him and the boy asked her about the man who cured people's illnesses
why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument
what are you doing here one of the figures demanded
he put his headcloth in place and secured it with a ring made of camel skin
here i am between my flock and my treasure the boy thought
advancing slowly they searched among the stones
when he's an old man he's going to spend a month in africa

the old man knew how to read and had already read the book
the boy and the englishman had bought camels and climbed uncertainly onto their backs
i don't know why
they were given to me as a present by a king the boy said
the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didn't matter
three days from now he would be with the merchant's daughter
that he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen
the merchants were assembling their stalls and the boy helped a candy seller to do his
they were surrounded by children curious to look at the animals and people that were arriving
i'm not going to charge you anything now she said
henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
from where i am the sun said i can see the soul of the world
only in that way would he be able to read the omens
then the old man began to inspect the sheep and he saw that one was lame
the people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses
he left without saying good bye to the crystal merchant
there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
when were these books written the boy asked
i don't want to change anything because i don't know how to deal with change
i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly
i don't much like change he said

he didn't know the man yet but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared
but the boy couldn't even speak
the old man leafed through the book and fell to reading a page he came to
with the wars between the tribes it's impossible to cross the desert
and above all don't forget to follow your destiny through to its conclusion
there was a small building there with a window at which people bought tickets to africa
the boy thanked him ate it and went on his way
the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
another person was there to help him toward his destiny
and there were dunes rocks and plants that insisted on living where survival seemed impossible
the boy was surprised at his thoughts
neighbors moved away and there remained only a few small shops on the hill
down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
he was thinking about omens and someone had appeared
he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
his eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the prophet
the merchant looked anxiously at the boy
no one attacks an oasis
ten years at the university and here i am in a corral
it's not often that money can save someone's life
and the falcon then nourishes man
i don't know the desert that well yet
the wind has many names
he stuck his hand into the pouch and felt around for one of the stones
the sun thought for a minute
and look how many things the wind already knew how to do
but the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept
because i don't live in either my past or my future
that was the law of hospitality
a breeze began to blow
your son went to serve at a distant place and became a centurion
sometimes their caravan met with another
what are these things he asked
he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep
i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
he tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the desert and its stones
he picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch
we were all made by the same hand and we have the same soul
they become a part of everything
then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments looking at the sword
because he was terrified the boy didn't answer
he didn't consider mending the hole ‚äî the stones could fall through any time they wanted
he called to the boy and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment
did you say a king he asked
the infidels had an evil look about them
it's called the principle of favorability beginner's luck
instead the stranger lowered it slowly until the point touched the boy's forehead
a while ago i rode through the desert with a man who had books on alchemy
he was excited and at the same time uneasy maybe the girl had already forgotten him
curse the moment i met that old man he thought
the only things that concerned the sheep were food and water
most of them were staring quietly at the big table
my name is melchizedek said the old man
it's called the principle of favorability
do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked
listen to your heart
sometimes there's just no way to hold back the river
he must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves
but the crystal merchant had no choice
it's not a battle of good against evil
he was alarmed by what had happened
it didn't bring with it the smell of the desert nor the threat of moorish invasion
the boy smiled and continued digging
it is i the boy answered
well then why did you let me do it the boy asked

it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
the boy spent a sleepless night
when the simum ceased to blow everyone looked to the place where the boy had been
it was the old man who spoke first
the boy knew the desert sensed his fear
everything on earth is being continuously transformed because the earth is alive
the boy promised himself that when he returned from egypt he would buy that sword
the day was dawning and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun
he has done so much ghostwriting that he starts to feel like a ghost too
they tell their incredible stories at the time when you want to hear them
there were mountains in the distance
maybe she didn't even remember him
i have the money i need to buy my sheep
because you are trying to realize your destiny
'everyone loved them and enjoyed them
there was a small building there with a window at which people bought tickets to africa
camels are traitorous they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire
the top had certainly ceased to rotate
and their eyes spoke of death
the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
i just want to dream about mecca
if someone isn't what others want them to be the others become angry
almost everyone here speaks spanish
thank you said the boy
no one seemed to have thought about it that night
the camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree observing the sunset
i could die happily and that made me feel good
the boy looked around him at the date palms
it's what you have always wanted to accomplish
and so despite the fact that he was a roman centurion he converted to their faith
i was impatient to see it opened
where is the treasure he asked
the wind has many names
when you are loved you can do anything in creation
the englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story
he was alarmed by what had happened
the wind began to pick up
at the first glance it was really not very exciting
the treasure is at the pyramids that you already knew
and in that mood he was grateful to be in love
he wasn't an alchemist
the boy offered his bottle hoping that the old man would leave him alone
the boy remembered his dream and suddenly everything was clear to him
i'm not hiding anything the boy answered
and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
the people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses
one day the earth began to tremble and the nile overflowed its banks
it's easy and yet i've never done it before he thought
it reminded him of the wool from his sheep
they went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to set
i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments looking at the sword
people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
i'm going to guide you across the desert the alchemist said
looking down at the spoon he held the boy saw that the oil was gone
go and speak to the tribal chieftains said the camel driver
the boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch
when the lead had become liquid the alchemist took from his pouch the strange yellow egg
he began to dig at the base of the sycamore
it's the oasis said the camel driver
i'll be back the boy said
the men were smoking their hookahs and trading stories from the battlefield
but then they wouldn't be a part of your future the seer had said
he knew how to shear them and how to slaughter them
he didn't know the man yet but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared
he had used the two stones only once one morning when he was at a marketplace
that's what alchemists do
he transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to the miner's foot
he was more confident in himself though and felt as though he could conquer the world
all things are one the boy thought
every day was there to be lived or to mark one's departure from this world
the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
all that time the martians must have been getting ready
i don't know how to find life in the desert the boy said
on the second day the boy climbed to the top of a cliff near the camp
two years ago right here on this spot i had a recurrent dream too
taking the jacket out he began to clean the glasses
it seemed so safe and tranquil
had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
from where he sat he could observe the plaza
the boy thought of fatima
the boy put the stones in his pouch
but he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind
and he immediately felt peace in his heart
when you are in love things make even more sense he thought
as he was leaving he saw in the corner of the room his old shepherd's pouch
on the seventh day the alchemist decided to make camp earlier than usual
and then the boy understood
worked hard just to have food and water like the sheep
what good is money to you if you're going to die
the streamer of gas came out towards us
your eyes show the strength of your soul answered the alchemist
it was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden
the desert was all sand in some stretches and rocky in others
the two men exchanged some words in arabic and the bar owner seemed irritated
the boy waited and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted
it was the levanter the wind that came from africa
but we could sell tea in crystal glasses
before long maybe in just a few days he would be at the pyramids
i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
and tomorrow his enemy would also be a part of that soul
what is it that i still need to know the boy asked
of course the two were unable to do anything
the boy began to dig into the dune
so then try he said to the englishman
no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
all they ever do really is look for food and water
he also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared the sheep
they were people of the desert and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities
no the alchemist answered
i want to see the chieftains
the woman was silent for some time
the englishman prodded him and the boy asked her about the man who cured people's illnesses
there's no danger the boy said when they had moved on past the encampment
if i don't find it i can always go home
we're refugees from the tribal wars and we need money the other figure said
as the englishman left fatima arrived and filled her vessel with water
but arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle
dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
its lower end was still embedded
air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
that's good thought the englishman
but finally he agreed that the boy who spoke better arabic than he should do so
you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
i am in search of that universal language among other things
the boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question
have trusted more in your love for fatima
you have been a real blessing to me
in alchemy it's called the soul of the world
the alchemist removed the pan from the fire and set it aside to cool
the meeting was over
it was more activity than usual for this time of the morning
his eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the prophet
there is a universal language understood by everybody but already forgotten
what are you doing here one of the figures demanded
i don't much like change he said
he put his headcloth in place and secured it with a ring made of camel skin
our merchants bought that man and brought him to egypt
he really was a king
later we simply let life proceed in its own direction toward its own fate
but he decided to take a chance
that doesn't happen to just anyone
continue in the direction of the pyramids said the alchemist
i've already had that experience with my sheep and now it's happening with people
as they moved along the boy tried to listen to his heart
he became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him
as they sat down at the only table in the place the crystal merchant laughed
you have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels
everyone has his or her own way of learning things he said to himself
the alchemist dismounted and told the escorts they could return to the camp
in those times the master work could be written simply on an emerald
maybe the church with the sycamore growing from within had been haunted
but maybe people who felt that way had never learned the universal language
it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
i waited all afternoon and evening he said
he prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass
he fell asleep and when he awoke the sun was already high
he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
curse the moment i met that old man he thought
i have had the same dream twice he said
the boy spent a sleepless night
he looked around at the empty plaza again feeling less desperate than before
the old man said nothing
i found these one day in the fields
am i going to find my treasure he asked
since the miner had sacrificed everything to his destiny the old man decided to become involved
they dismounted and the alchemist said nothing
i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
one afternoon one of his servants fell ill and it appeared that he would die
no one attacks an oasis
when i'm eating that's all i think about
i heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist the wind said
i've had this shop for thirty years
and there were dunes rocks and plants that insisted on living where survival seemed impossible
but then he stopped
this is why alchemy exists the boy said
the war continued and at times the wind carried the sweet sickly smell of blood
it was a tent like many at the oasis
replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
he was planning as he left the bar
everything in life is an omen said the englishman now closing the journal he was reading
and i'm certain you'll find it the alchemist said
what are they doing the old man asked pointing at the people in the plaza
you brought a new feeling into my crystal shop
the boy went to his room and packed his belongings
he got up adjusted his clothing and picked up his pouch
they sang the same tunes at each party
don't knock on death's door ring the doorbell and run
even with night vision googles no target was in sight
more haste less speed

our merchants bought that man and brought him to egypt
he looked around at the empty plaza again feeling less desperate than before
it's like the camel driver said 'eat when it's time to eat
the boy watched the exchange with fascination
the old man was probably a gypsy too
that's true the boy thought
the boy was relieved
that first day everyone slept from exhaustion including the englishman
at his side was the young arab the boy had spoken with earlier
nature knows me as the wisest being in creation the sun said
men dream more about coming home than about leaving the boy said
he appeared with the first stars of evening
let's go and have some lunch said the crystal merchant
we'll have something to drink and eat these hawks
others stumbled upon the stone by accident
imagine if everyone went around transforming lead into gold
what are these things he asked
the omens will begin insistently to speak of it and you'll try to ignore them
he wandered for a while keeping the date palms of the oasis within sight
there was a time when for me a camel's whinnying was nothing more than whinnying
and i'm certain you'll find it the alchemist said
now it will be with hope
then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments looking at the sword
as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
i wanted to sleep a little longer he thought
are you crazy the boy asked the alchemist when they had moved on
i kept my eyes fixed on the cylinder and began pushing my way back from the edge of the pit
this is why alchemy exists the boy said
well he thought about that the old man said
he asked it please never to stop speaking to him
it was more activity than usual for this time of the morning
maybe that's why they always stay close to me
but you are forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons i have never known
no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
people talk a lot about omens thought the shepherd
now he was here not with his flock but with a shovel
the streamer of gas came out towards us
he had studied latin spanish and theology
on the second day the boy climbed to the top of a cliff near the camp
taking the jacket out he began to clean the glasses
yes or even search for treasure
the boy watched as his companion went to his horse and withdrew a scimitar
the boy smiled and continued digging
among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
we are part of that soul so we rarely recognize that it is working for us
we're refugees from the tribal wars and we need money the other figure said
my name is melchizedek said the old man
an old man with a breastplate of gold wouldn't have lied just to acquire six sheep
the boy closed his book
but he didn't stop
all they wanted was food and water
that's why i feel that i deserve a part of what you find
then she again took his hands and studied them carefully
'and this is what your son said' the angel told the man
when he's an old man he's going to spend a month in africa
but there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing mint tea
he took back his books and packed them away again in their bags
the horseman was completely immobile as was the boy
rest well tonight as if you were a warrior preparing for combat
he stuck his hand into the pouch and felt around for one of the stones
but now i'm sad and alone
i don‚äôt mind working from home most of the time but i do miss having coworkers
the crowd on the far left seemed to get bigger and i heard now a faint murmur from it
the hookahs were extinguished and the guards stood at attention
then suddenly he noticed it with a start
we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
he was proud of himself
walking along in the silence he had no regrets
some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
and he immediately felt peace in his heart
he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
let's get out of here said the new arrival
the boy accustomed to recognizing omens spoke to the merchant
a monk dressed in black came to the gates
but then he stopped
maybe we'd better ask someone the boy suggested
if what one finds is made of pure matter it will never spoil
fatima the girl said averting her eyes
the boy had met the alchemist
he has other things to do first
they don't see that the fields are new and the seasons change
all they ever do really is look for food and water
i'll be back the boy said
somewhere you are holding the person i love the boy said
he knew he was stronger than his friend
the camel driver was not a fighter and he had consulted with seers
he recited an our father silently
another dreamer said the ticket seller to his assistant watching the boy walk away
before the sun had reached its high point five hundred tribesmen appeared on the horizon
he paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the egyptian pyramids were
he told me i should try to do so
suddenly there is so much more time in a day because she no longer has to spend hours commuting
they eat lunch together often but don‚äôt really talk outside the office
some do come back
then the old man began to inspect the sheep and he saw that one was lame
there was a full moon and the boy told the englishman the story of his life
why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument
they're just a pile of stones
i thought that someday i'd be rich and could go to mecca
the next day the boy returned to the well hoping to see the girl
when he reached the top of the dune his heart leapt
the day was hot and the wine was refreshing
at the first glance it was really not very exciting
so the boy was disappointed he decided that he would never again believe in dreams
i sold crystal and crossed the desert
the boy leapt as well but away from the alchemist
only in that way would he be able to read the omens
the boy approached her to ask about the alchemist
he thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert
she keeps saying that she has no regrets about moving back home but i‚äôm not sure if it‚äôs entirely true
they seemed to laugh at him and he laughed back his heart bursting with joy
after all who doesn‚äôt want to overcome new challenges and achieve great heights
they were both silent for a time observing the plaza and the townspeople
he sat looking at the sky for a long time
they said nothing else
the restaurant was quite expensive
i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument
and so despite the fact that he was a roman centurion he converted to their faith
do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked
ten years at the university and here i am in a corral
there is no help for it
remind me to buy some eggs next time i am at the store
the sheep were led home by a dog
he shrugged his shoulders
it was hidden from sight by a mass of leaves and shrubs
we need to ski down the hill before the sun sets
joy shared is double joy grief shared is only half grief
where did it come from then
he slipped on the stairs
well i think so

ducks fly north but lack a compass
the scalpel incision was clean and straight

i won't ever tell a soul
he forgets the office when he's with me
what is playing at the closest movie house
alice who the fuck is bob
the runway seems way too short for this type of plane
reading is not the same as understanding
if you tackled these outliers that would reduce the artifacts
many drops make a shower
the football game ended with neither team scoring a single point
it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
this is a grand season for hikes on the road
what are you going to do
what's the matter with you
she did not answer
the homeless guy was searching for returnable bottles in a garbage dumpster
should i understand the emerald tablet the boy asked
in those times the master work could be written simply on an emerald
and what do you do in salem he insisted
i myself heard nothing of that
mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies
looking down at the spoon he held the boy saw that the oil was gone
all they think about is food and water
as the sun rose the men began to beat the boy
when i returned to the common the sun was setting
he left without saying good bye to the crystal merchant
you have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels
drink and enjoy yourself said the alchemist noticing that the boy was feeling happier
that's not true the boy said
it's almost as if he had been here and left his mark he thought
those gypsies are really smart he thought
hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
it brought his heart into his mouth
it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
but they were not there
it means only that the heart does what it can the alchemist said
i think it's about bird hunting but now i can see how that might be misinterpreted
he was able to get on his knees but he quickly slipped back
he regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert
he remembered the sword
when she saw the unknown object bobbing up and down the edge she was absolutely horrified
the boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy but saw none
when he was a child that man wanted to travel too
i'm not going very far the alchemist answered looking straight into the eyes of the horsemen
no one paid any attention to the two travelers
he had seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands
i don't know how to turn them into reality
but the tradition also says that we should believe the messages of the desert
he thought of all the married shepherds he had known
one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
i found these one day in the fields
fatima is a woman of the desert said the alchemist
in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation
he had suddenly remembered that in tarifa there was an old woman who interpreted dreams
suddenly he disappeared and i could hear a faint shriek behind the walls
the camel driver though seemed not to be very concerned with the threat of war
but as he saw them lying there on the ground another phrase came to his mind
they could barely see the boy
i'm the king of salem the old man had said
i still have no idea how to turn myself into the wind the boy repeated
it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
i'm not going to charge you anything now she said
throughout the night the boy dug at the place he had chosen but found nothing
the land was ruined and i had to find some other way to earn a living
i was impatient to see it opened
he paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the egyptian pyramids were
i don't know the desert that well yet
and what do you do in salem he insisted
the sheep had taught him that
the wind began to blow again
gold would lose its value
it was the time of day when all of spain slept during the summer
who is your friend the chief asked
people talk a lot about omens thought the shepherd
the merchant looked anxiously at the boy
what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
the miner had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds
one afternoon one of his servants fell ill and it appeared that he would die
i'm going to go back to doing just what i did before the boy thought
i am definitely open to the idea because i‚äôve always wanted to work as a small business owner
she knows that men have to go away in order to return
it was a tent like many at the oasis
i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy
if good things are coming they will be a pleasant surprise said the seer
you have a mania for simplifying everything answered the englishman irritated
by the light of their own destruction i saw them staggering and falling and their supporters turning to run
why did you want to see me the boy asked
for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
the genies were the spirits of good and evil
then taking his sheep he walked away
but the englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it
a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
but he certainly didn't desire that an army invade the oasis
the men climbed the hill and they were tired when they reached the top
all i saw was an army said the boy
i can interpret it but the interpretation is very difficult
where are you bound asked the young arab
the war is going to end someday the girl said
the boy closed his book
the years of research the magic symbols the strange words and the laboratory equipment
the shepherd swore that he would
he saw that fatima's eyes were filled with tears
the stranger withdrew the sword from the boy's forehead and the boy felt immensely relieved
i understand sheep they're no longer a problem and they can be good friends
they both spoke the same language
the arab accepted them without a word
in any case it's good that you've learned that everything in life has its price
that's never happened to me the boy said
i'm surprised the boy said
for a moment everything was dark and scary
i shall make us some ice cubes
but they don't count
the sun thought for a minute
and for wise men gold is the metal that evolved the furthest
from there he could see africa in the distance
he remembered something his grandfather had once told him that butterflies were a good omen
he told me i should try to do so
to realize one's destiny is a person's only real obligation
but we could sell tea in crystal glasses
there were mountains in the distance
i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
but arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle
but finally he agreed that the boy who spoke better arabic than he should do so
i'm afraid that if my dream is realized i'll have no reason to go on living
on the very first page it described a burial ceremony
and that he a boy could perform miracles
the alchemist probably already knew all that
and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
to do that successfully i must have no fear of failure
if i don't find it i can always go home
they wanted to save the oasis
if what one finds is made of pure matter it will never spoil
as he did so he talked with the monk about the tribal wars
he really was a king
i've learned things from the sheep and i've learned things from crystal he thought
the boy approached her to ask about the alchemist
something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded
the young arab took out a book and began to read
i'll be back the boy said
don't let them see that you're afraid the alchemist said
i was wondering if you would work on this project with me because i can‚äôt find anyone else
a friend had told the boy about the shop and he had taken his sheep there
they never have to make any decisions he thought
it was a strange furnace fueled by firewood with a transparent flask heating on top
the next day the boy returned to the well hoping to see the girl
give me my book the boy said
the boy promised himself that when he returned from egypt he would buy that sword
but the boy was quiet
the boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question
before the sun had reached its high point five hundred tribesmen appeared on the horizon
suddenly a huge quantity of green smoke came out of the pit in three puffs and went straight into the still air
the dead soldiers were replaced by others and life went on
no the alchemist answered
the boy didn't want to talk about the pyramids
there are powerful forces on both sides and the war is important to both armies
it was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden
the levanter was still getting stronger and he felt its force on his face
you have to cross the entire sahara desert said the young man
the boy was surprised and then irritated
it had a diameter of about thirty yards
everyone on earth has a treasure that awaits him his heart said
and he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals

it's the name of the prophet's daughter fatima said
what are these things he asked
vibrations of peace throughout the tent
but he granted the travelers three days
they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation

he watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind

the boy was strong and wanted to retaliate but he was in a foreign country
the old man knew how to read and had already read the book
the boy didn't say anything
they were people of the desert and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities
it was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden
he took out his money and counted it
it has happened many times before
the man was speaking the language of alchemy
had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
there was enough there to buy a lot of weapons
it seemed so safe and tranquil
he thought of the merchant's daughter and was sure that she had probably married

and for wise men gold is the metal that evolved the furthest
the camel driver was not a fighter and he had consulted with seers
it required no explanation just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time
and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
in order to find the treasure you will have to follow the omens
the wind approached the boy and touched his face
but then he stopped
his heart squeezed as if his chest had suddenly compressed it
it didn't bring with it the smell of the desert nor the threat of moorish invasion
what are these things he asked
are you crazy the boy asked the alchemist when they had moved on
he saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes
a boy came running towards me
don‚äôt share your opinions so readily because you never know who is listening
there was very little talking
it was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted
he was excited and at the same time uneasy maybe the girl had already forgotten him
what's the fifth obligation the boy asked
he had already seen many people come and go and the desert remained as it was
and he gave the boy his blessing
the horse reared again raising a cloud of dust
they never have to make any decisions he thought
maybe he should not call people names that they don't want to be called
they spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didn't understand any of it
because the crystal was dirty
they stood there looking at the moon
but the boy was quiet
he asked it please never to stop speaking to him
i just want to dream about mecca
what is an alchemist he asked finally
trust in your heart but never forget that you're in the desert
i thought that someday i'd be rich and could go to mecca
i'm a woman of the desert she said averting her face
the alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear
some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
he quickly pulled his hands away
based on the omens of the present
the englishman had several suitcases filled with books
i learned how to care for sheep and i haven't forgotten how that's done
the boy said nothing
the alchemist's words echoed out like a curse
the war continued and at times the wind carried the sweet sickly smell of blood
have trusted more in your love for fatima
but everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time
i've had this shop for thirty years
it's too bad that he's quickly going to forget my name he thought
with every day that passed the boy's heart became more and more silent
maybe tomorrow said the boy moving away
the englishman was disappointed
the boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across the desert
the gods should not have desires because they don't have destinies
he really was a king
he seemed unfriendly and had looked irritated when the boy had entered
it was the pure language of the world
the only things that concerned the sheep were food and water
i can learn something from the desert too
even me ‚äî i haven't thought of other women since i met the merchant's daughter
i need to sell some wool the boy told the merchant
the sun was turned into a golden disk
from then on he would make his own decisions
i heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist the wind said
on the second day the boy climbed to the top of a cliff near the camp
i don't know why these things have to be transmitted by word of mouth he thought
the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
and yet none of these people has ever met the old king
as he was attempting to pull out the rocks he encountered he heard footsteps
death doesn't change anything the boy thought
alchemy is a serious discipline
don't give in to your fears said the alchemist in a strangely gentle voice
do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked
and he told what he had seen
drink and enjoy yourself said the alchemist noticing that the boy was feeling happier
the englishman was unable to sleep one night
most of them were staring quietly at the big table
a current of love rushed from his heart and the boy began to pray
the world speaks many languages the boy thought
we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
what's your name he asked
everyone when they are young knows what their destiny is
the caravans had been stopped at giza for some time waiting for the wars to end
what he said reminded the boy of the old king
one is loved because one is loved
gypsies are experts at getting people to do that sighed the old man
his eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the prophet
he walked slowly through the market
how did you learn to read the girl asked at one point
none of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy
he won't leave the circle
it's a man who understands nature and the world
the men climbed the hill and they were tired when they reached the top
now i can see that it hasn't been too bad
i promised that i would make my own decisions he said to himself
how do people celebrate good weather over there
these are the spies said one of the men
then came the night of the first falling star
the omens had told him so
the camel driver though seemed not to be very concerned with the threat of war
why a revolver he asked
his hands began to tremble and the woman sensed it
that's the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life
the old woman had said the same thing
the omens had been true after all
but you are forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons i have never known
and i'd better read your books said the boy
it was bunched up and he had hardly thought of it for a long time
looking at the sun he calculated that he would reach tarifa before midday
the boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby listening attentively to their conversation
until then he had considered the omens to be things of this world
last time i made the mistake of replicating a drawing by rodin
two days later the merchant spoke to the boy about the display
neighbors moved away and there remained only a few small shops on the hill
and i'm certain you'll find it the alchemist said
the conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss
no the alchemist answered
help me the boy said
at the camp it was difficult to see anything
the alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery
if good things are coming they will be a pleasant surprise said the seer
it knew of the boy's talk with the desert because the winds know everything
he called to the boy and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment
just by looking at them
but he kept the sword in his hand
fatima was more important than his treasure
there are rumors of tribal wars he told them
the scabbard was embossed in silver and the handle was black and encrusted with precious stones
a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sit down and let me treat you to something said the boy
it means only that the heart does what it can the alchemist said
the serpent relaxed immediately
suddenly he disappeared and i could hear a faint shriek behind the walls
they become a part of everything
he knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in
maybe we'd better ask someone the boy suggested
he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
they continued across the desert
the three fell silent
he told me i should try to do so
he was thinking about omens and someone had appeared
and you've told me about omens
it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
and don't forget the language of omens
the heat lasted until nightfall and all that time he had to carry his jacket
he had used the two stones only once one morning when he was at a marketplace
speak to the hand that wrote all said the sun
let me tell you what will happen
he told them all to be seated
taking the jacket out he began to clean the glasses
if i had told you you wouldn't have seen the pyramids
but children always seem to be able to play with them without frightening them
he had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind
the englishman vanished too gone to find the alchemist
that's what alchemists do
this was my destiny not yours the alchemist answered
go back to watching the caravan he said
but i was also stumbling because i couldn‚äôt look away from these things
we could get to the pyramids by tomorrow said the other taking the money
the first day passed
the merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses
he started to read the book he had bought
i still have no idea how to turn myself into the wind the boy repeated
then one day the boy returned the books to the englishman
but my heart is agitated the boy said
it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
the boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy but saw none
he watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind
in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
the vision vanished immediately but it had shaken him
he became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him
the boy looked around him at the date palms
i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
to show you one of life's simple lessons the alchemist answered
then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments looking at the sword
the boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question
i'm the leader of the caravan said a dark eyed bearded man
he waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop
it was a a kind of fascination that paralysed my actions
they said nothing else
and he immediately felt peace in his heart
the boy tried to read what was written in the sand
two years ago right here on this spot i had a recurrent dream too
the wind began to pick up
the boy wanted to take her hand
the boy knew the desert sensed his fear
he suddenly felt tremendously happy
he prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass
the boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day
he needs three days answered the alchemist
there are powerful forces on both sides and the war is important to both armies
can i help you asked the man behind the window
i read only what the birds wanted to tell me
it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
now it will be with hope
i'm coming fatima he said
three days from now he would be with the merchant's daughter
i've learned things from the sheep and i've learned things from crystal he thought
he just got a new kite for his birthday
it looked like a rusty gas float
only the lights in the great tent remained
i have already found my treasure
i'll be back the boy said
the englishman's eyes lit up
the two walked out among the palms
when you are in love things make even more sense he thought
toward the end of the afternoon they came upon a coptic monastery
now leave us alone said the boy to the young arab
for a moment everything was dark and scary
but the englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it
and the girl pointed to the south indicating that it was there the strange man lived
they both spoke the same language
when the lead had become liquid the alchemist took from his pouch the strange yellow egg
treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly
there's life here the boy said to the alchemist
all things are one the boy thought
he still had some doubts about the decision he had made
the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
the years of research the magic symbols the strange words and the laboratory equipment
if he makes a buying mistake it doesn't affect him much
and tomorrow his enemy would also be a part of that soul
he remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn't even have yet
upon returning to the wise man he related in detail everything he had seen
i want to stay at the oasis the boy answered
because you'll know its dreams and wishes and will know how to deal with them
the horizon was tinged with red and suddenly the sun appeared
because you will never again be able to keep it quiet
the genies were the spirits of good and evil
that night he told all of this to the alchemist
they were relieved and happy
as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
it doesn't matter he said to his sheep
i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
but that was simply because my eye was tired
the boy told him then that he needed to get to the pyramids
but i'm going to egypt the boy said
i know its dimensions and how it behaves
they crossed the desert for another two days in silence
there is no wine in this country the young man said
whenever he could he sought out a new road to travel
what was written on the emerald tablet the boy wanted to know
and seizing the boy's bag the alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief
he arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept
i'd like you to take me there if you can
it's almost as if he had been here and left his mark he thought
they are so used to me that they know my schedule he muttered
those gypsies are really smart he thought
what kind of blow should one deliver next in order to remain alive
people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
this desert was once a sea he said
the hookahs were extinguished and the guards stood at attention
relaxed and unhurried he resolved that he would walk through the narrow streets of tangier
the meeting was over
and one or two persons were returning
what is a foreigner doing here asked another of the men
the next day he gave his son a pouch that held three ancient spanish gold coins
ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
it's the name of the prophet's daughter fatima said
the tradition teaches men how to cross the desert and how their children should marry
it didn't even occur to the boy to flee
and so despite the fact that he was a roman centurion he converted to their faith
we don't know when the war will end so we can't continue our journey he said
it was a cobra whose venom could kill a person in minutes
he was shaken into wakefulness by someone
but he knew that salem wasn't in andalusia
he took back his books and packed them away again in their bags
i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
the war is going to end someday the girl said
he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
if what one finds is made of pure matter it will never spoil
i've already told you
who is this stranger who speaks of omens asked one of the chieftains eyeing the boy
but the boy never took his eye off his new friend
to realize one's destiny is a person's only real obligation
let's stop this another commander said
exactly answered the alchemist
but if you can try to make your own decisions
but the englishman was exultant
the boy was also saddened his friend was in pursuit of his destiny
but we could sell tea in crystal glasses
listen to your heart
the alchemist dismounted and told the escorts they could return to the camp
in his hand he grasped a snake by the tail
the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
without responding the guard entered the tent where he remained for some time
did you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create
and then there were the others who were interested only in gold
tell me more about your dream said the woman
the shop was busy and the man asked the shepherd to wait until the afternoon
my friend bought all the other sheep immediately
i want you to be my wife
down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
every search begins with beginner's luck
love is the force that transforms and improves the soul of the world
and the alchemist understood that the boy's heart had returned to the soul of the world
for every ten dead men among our enemies you will receive a piece of gold
maktub the boy said remembering the crystal merchant
maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is
since the miner had sacrificed everything to his destiny the old man decided to become involved
the people were also praying to heaven for protection
the book was written in spanish
why did you want to see me the boy asked
the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
the wind told me that you know about love the boy said to the sun
don't say that again
he didn't want to cry with the other people there
they were his treasure
am i going to find my treasure he asked
suddenly the monster disappeared
then the thing came upon him in a flash
it's not often that money can save someone's life
an army is coming the boy said
just handling them made him feel better
finally a young woman approached who was not dressed in black
i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
they eat lunch together often but don‚äôt really talk outside the office
it gave a peculiarly sharp cry
he loosened the reins on his horse who galloped forward over the rocks and sand
but finally he agreed that the boy who spoke better arabic than he should do so
the boy was surprised
they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
i only interpret dreams
i'm interested only in the present
there was a thud like the fall of a great mass
will you give me your blessing asked the boy
and also because i know about the soul of the world he thought to himself
another dreamer said the ticket seller to his assistant watching the boy walk away
a part of me is also trying to come to terms with the fact that i won't be able to travel as much anymore
once you get into the desert there's no going back said the camel driver
the boy smiled to himself
from atop its walls one can catch a glimpse of africa
we'll leave tomorrow before sunrise was the alchemist's only response
for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
if someone isn't what others want them to be the others become angry
you're the one who may die the alchemist said
mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies
does a man's heart always help him the boy asked the alchemist
our merchants bought that man and brought him to egypt
i have been waiting for her to respond for two days now so i just went ahead and did it for her
if i'm on the march i just concentrate on marching
because you have already lost your savings twice
the caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis
almost everyone here speaks spanish
he wanted to say so to the alchemist but he was afraid of the man
and the falcon then nourishes man
he was older and was carrying a small bucket
well then why did you let me do it the boy asked
she would never know the difference because she didn't know how to read
there was a full moon and the boy told the englishman the story of his life
i can interpret it but the interpretation is very difficult
they were looking only for gold his companion answered
the people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses
there is only one way to learn the alchemist answered
they wanted to save the oasis
well why did you say that i don't know about love the sun asked the boy
no one said a word as the old man continued
before the sun had reached its high point five hundred tribesmen appeared on the horizon
the boy and the englishman had bought camels and climbed uncertainly onto their backs
there's no danger the boy said when they had moved on past the encampment
besides that there was a heap of bicycles
an old man with a breastplate of gold wouldn't have lied just to acquire six sheep
what are you doing here one of the figures demanded
he came to understand its dodges and tricks and to accept it as it was
others stumbled upon the stone by accident
the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didn't matter
he could always go back to being a shepherd
it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
when were these books written the boy asked
but he didn't stop
to nourish the falcon
i'm afraid that if my dream is realized i'll have no reason to go on living
that's never happened to me the boy said
when the sun sets the men will once again surrender their arms to me
the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
it's what you have always wanted to accomplish
they rode for the entire day
well he thought about that the old man said
he thought of all the married shepherds he had known
you old sorcerer the boy shouted up to the sky
so it's better to listen to what it has to say
where are you bound asked the young arab
they were surrounded by children curious to look at the animals and people that were arriving
but as time passed tangier had changed
but in his heart he knew that it did matter
they were on the right track
but instead of being saddened he was happy
i'm going with you the boy said
what is it you're looking for asked the old merchant
but they don't count
so the boy was disappointed he decided that he would never again believe in dreams
from there he could see africa in the distance
it's called the principle of favorability
i told him we could teach her to ignore people who waste her time
another person was there to help him toward his destiny
the boy was relieved
hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
no one attacks an oasis
he paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the egyptian pyramids were
so what should i do now the boy asked
and one can always come back
it made me very depressed
if a person is living out his destiny he knows everything he needs to know
the boy laughed ‚äî out of happiness
they called that discovery the master work ‚äî it was part liquid and part solid
and in that mood he was grateful to be in love
some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other
something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded
i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
and eventually man will nourish your sands where the game will once again flourish
when i'm eating that's all i think about
as they moved along the boy tried to listen to his heart
when she saw the unknown object bobbing up and down the edge she was absolutely horrified
but the crystal merchant had no choice
none of this ha d made an impression on the boy
but that's why you created the game in the first place the boy answered
all things are one the old man had said
from where he sat he could observe the plaza
when i returned to the common the sun was setting
wasn't that a swell story we gave you
advertisements are rarely hosted by the same web server as the actual content

the frog climbed the tower
it sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself
we've been laughing all day about that
flash grenades explode with a loud bang and cause disorientation
a young arab also loaded down with baggage entered and greeted the englishman
it was the old man who spoke first
tomorrow sell your camel and buy a horse
i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
the mixture took on a reddish color almost the color of blood
then he sat in the sun filled doorway smoking the hookah
the invaders carried the name everywhere the beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride
in his heart he wanted to remain awake but he also wanted to sleep
my name is melchizedek said the old man
life attracts life the alchemist answered
i'd like to build a display case for the crystal the boy said to the merchant
he had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind
there was no way for everybody to know about alchemy
and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
the scabbard was embossed in silver and the handle was black and encrusted with precious stones
everywhere there were stalls with items for sale
but my heart is agitated the boy said
the tribal chieftains will see that and you'll be dismissed from your position as counselor
he wanted your money he said
they blow across the world without a birthplace and with no place to die
he was more confident in himself though and felt as though he could conquer the world
two years ago right here on this spot i had a recurrent dream too
they're only made of rock crystal and there are millions of rock crystals in the earth
and he gave the boy his blessing
all who went there were happy at having done so
this is for you he said holding one of the parts out to the monk
but you will love her and she'll return your love
the secret is here in the present
no that's not what i mean
the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didn't matter
the city was still sleeping
one afternoon one of his servants fell ill and it appeared that he would die
the alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery
fatima the girl said averting her eyes
on the second day the boy climbed to the top of a cliff near the camp
they didn't have the printing press in those days the boy argued
when he emerged it was with a young arab dressed in white and gold
that's why i feel that i deserve a part of what you find
he stuck his hand into the pouch and felt around for one of the stones
then one day the boy returned the books to the englishman
it means only that the heart does what it can the alchemist said
i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
and you ought to read more about the world answered the englishman
the shop is exactly the size i always wanted it to be
so then try he said to the englishman
on the seventh day the alchemist decided to make camp earlier than usual
he must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves
it's true life really is generous to those who pursue their destiny the boy thought
there are rumors of tribal wars he told them
the woman was silent for some time
the two walked out among the palms
we're refugees from the tribal wars and we need money the other figure said
he took out his money and counted it
some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other
maybe we're all that way the boy mused
the boy knew the desert sensed his fear
he had studied latin spanish and theology
the boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure
and if you improve on the present what comes later will also be better
but now the sounds inside had stopped
let's the alchemist answered
maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership
they were both silent for a time observing the plaza and the townspeople
they forgot that lead copper and iron have their own destinies to fulfill
no he heard a voice on the wind say
the englishman didn't answer him directly
all the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared
i know its dimensions and how it behaves
that's the magic of omens said the boy
he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
now i too will be one of the women who wait
then suddenly they kneel and die
but he certainly didn't desire that an army invade the oasis
i learned how to care for sheep and i haven't forgotten how that's done
the area was swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view
at the highest point in tarifa there is an old fort built by the moors
they began to ride out over the sands with the moon lighting their way
the merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses
meanwhile the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation

in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars

and the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have
it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
when i returned to the common the sun was setting
the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
i wished i had a light to smoke by
the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
then the thing came upon him in a flash
as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
i was impatient to see it opened
so how will we name all these hurricanes
many telescopes were pointed at it
there was very little talking
i‚äîi was terribly worried
i wonder what's keeping mother

the pink love heart keyring glowed

my freezer contains enough for a banquet
you know how dreams are
gypsies are experts at getting people to do that sighed the old man
i'll take that bet
only the lights in the great tent remained

he recited an our father silently
i've heard her speak of you
lindsey promised to call you from new york tonight
everything you need to know you have learned through your journey
had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
the old man said nothing
and above all don't forget to follow your destiny through to its conclusion
i had that right here
the alchemist turned to the boy
i'm still having trouble with baking
just as your grandfather taught you
will you put that thing away
just use the phone
give me my book the boy said
they become a part of everything
they never have to make any decisions he thought
that bold remark will be remembered for a long time
one afternoon one of his servants fell ill and it appeared that he would die
we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
its lower end was still embedded
he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer

the boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure
in his hand he grasped a snake by the tail
many telescopes were pointed at it
his heart was heavy and he had been melancholy since the previous night
the englishman was disappointed
the boy thought of fatima
the only things that concerned the sheep were food and water
something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded
he transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to the miner's foot
the boy wanted to take her hand
the boy leapt as well but away from the alchemist
you old sorcerer the boy shouted up to the sky
he told fatima that at their next meeting
since the miner had sacrificed everything to his destiny the old man decided to become involved
and in that mood he was grateful to be in love
without responding the guard entered the tent where he remained for some time
should i understand the emerald tablet the boy asked
now i too will be one of the women who wait
everyone on earth has a treasure that awaits him his heart said
that day he didn't make a cast
even from a distance their eyes conveyed the strength of their souls
the alchemist turned to the boy
upon returning to the wise man he related in detail everything he had seen
then the old man began to inspect the sheep and he saw that one was lame
and he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved
the boy awoke before dawn
suddenly a huge quantity of green smoke came out of the pit in three puffs and went straight into the still air
some do come back
can't you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language the boy asked
the horseman was completely immobile as was the boy
i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
in order to find the treasure you will have to follow the omens
it's too bad that he's quickly going to forget my name he thought
maybe he should not call people names that they don't want to be called
but don't worry the alchemist continued
he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
let me tell you what will happen
the streamer of gas came out towards us
but there was something there in his heart that wouldn't allow him to do so
then like a colony of worker ants they dismantled their stalls and left
the day was dawning and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun
we'll have something to drink and eat these hawks
just by looking at them
the battles may last for a long time perhaps even years
he needs three days answered the alchemist
finally a young woman approached who was not dressed in black
he still had some doubts about the decision he had made
he ran his fingers slowly over the stones sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces
he could always go back to being a shepherd
i want to see the chieftains
because of the omens the alchemist answered
what kind of blow should one deliver next in order to remain alive
people talk a lot about omens thought the shepherd
everything has been written by the same hand
i have to separate out the sulfur
then the thing came upon him in a flash
i don't much like change he said
we were all made by the same hand and we have the same soul
the years of research the magic symbols the strange words and the laboratory equipment
he was thinking about omens and someone had appeared
he remembered something his grandfather had once told him that butterflies were a good omen
and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
why would a king be talking with a shepherd the boy asked awed and embarrassed
the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
i understand sheep they're no longer a problem and they can be good friends
that's the magic of omens said the boy
the caravan began to travel day and night

and then there were the others who were interested only in gold
the boy was surprised and then irritated
at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
the treasure is at the pyramids that you already knew
and they had understood each other perfectly well
he was shaken into wakefulness by someone
he loosened the reins on his horse who galloped forward over the rocks and sand
i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
it required no explanation just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time
it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience

my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
a card hanging in the doorway announced that several languages were spoken in the shop
i turned and as i did so the screw must have fallen out
but you will love her and she'll return your love
i heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist the wind said
but the englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it
the boy trusted his new friend

because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert the boy said

what he said reminded the boy of the old king
first he had studied esperanto then the world's religions and now it was alchemy
hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
it was there that the wise man lived
it was a bundle of money
but none of that mattered to the alchemist
he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
they provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes
you didn't have to do any cleaning he said
i noticed that the boy answered

that first day everyone slept from exhaustion including the englishman
i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy
the top had certainly ceased to rotate
there was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the city was asleep
he arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept
i thought that everything i owned would be destroyed
let's get out of here said the new arrival
maybe it was because they moved around so much
the boy promised himself that when he returned from egypt he would buy that sword

i turned and as i did so the screw must have fallen out
the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
am i going to find my treasure he asked
i still have no idea how to turn myself into the wind the boy repeated
the boy didn't say anything
he thought that with some patience he'd be able to transform everything into gold

whenever he saw the sea or a fire he fell silent impressed by their elemental force

a monk dressed in black came to the gates

every day was there to be lived or to mark one's departure from this world
you have a mania for simplifying everything answered the englishman irritated
the englishman had several suitcases filled with books
but there was something there in his heart that wouldn't allow him to do so
at the highest point in tarifa there is an old fort built by the moors
as he was attempting to pull out the rocks he encountered he heard footsteps
dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church
one afternoon they passed by the encampment of one of the tribes
but that was simply because my eye was tired
treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly
among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
that's the way it always is said the old man
it's a man who understands nature and the world
as the sun rose the men began to beat the boy
he had come to the town only to find a woman who could interpret his dream
but there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing mint tea
i want you to be my wife
they went in to drink the tea which was served in beautiful crystal glasses
i didn't come here to have you read my palm he said already regretting having come
the boy trusted his new friend
when the sun sets the men will once again surrender their arms to me
i should have repeated it for him
the englishman was disappointed
the animals were exhausted and the men talked among themselves less and less
they are so used to me that they know my schedule he muttered
he put a sign on the door and they went to a small cafe nearby
but the king of salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful
he jumped up and turned quickly to face the imagined terror screaming get back
we can describe the object's movement with a differential equation of second order

he hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice

the men were smoking their hookahs and trading stories from the battlefield
the old man knew how to read and had already read the book
should i understand the emerald tablet the boy asked
they were people of the desert and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities
i'll work all night until dawn and i'll clean every piece of crystal in your shop
the boy knew the desert sensed his fear
all things are one the old man had said
it's the oasis said the camel driver
the simum blew that day as it had never blown before
the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
i've had this shop for thirty years
the old man returned the book to the boy
something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
there was nothing to hold him back except himself
he was more certain of it than of anything in the world
it's not often that money can save someone's life
i'm the leader of the caravan said a dark eyed bearded man
the man looked at the angel in surprise
trust in your heart but never forget that you're in the desert
those gypsies are really smart he thought
the sun thought for a minute
the battles may last for a long time perhaps even years
he seemed unfriendly and had looked irritated when the boy had entered
the following night the boy appeared at the alchemist's tent with a horse
he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep
and finally the falcon returned with their meal
the boy remembered an old proverb from his country
he wanted to forget about the vision and return to his meditation
the boy laughed ‚äî out of happiness
but you will love her and she'll return your love

then i don't get paid
what is an alchemist he asked finally
the alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy's cup
the old man looked disappointed
but that was simply because my eye was tired
the monk was irritated
and he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals
in any case it's good that you've learned that everything in life has its price
i want to see the chieftains
everywhere there were stalls with items for sale
the alchemist was a bit daunting but as the boy drank the wine he relaxed
in his heart he wanted to remain awake but he also wanted to sleep
and continue to pay heed to the omens
so he asked if the old man's blessing was still with him
maybe that's why they always stay close to me
those gypsies are really smart he thought

the boy offered his bottle hoping that the old man would leave him alone
it was the first time either had touched the other
he reached over and picked up a shell from the ground
well i'd like to see their land and see how they live said his son

he was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned
i am proud of you he said
i'm going to go back to doing just what i did before the boy thought
the only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion

he quickly pulled his hands away
the crowd on the far left seemed to get bigger and i heard now a faint murmur from it
tomorrow sell your camel and buy a horse
there's no danger the boy said when they had moved on past the encampment
what's the world's greatest lie the boy asked completely surprised
some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other
but everything had changed
he saw that fatima's eyes were filled with tears
i don't know why
because he was terrified the boy didn't answer
the englishman was disappointed
and he immediately felt peace in his heart

the closer he got to the realization of his dream the more difficult things became
the tea seemed less bitter
he dressed in his arabian clothing of white linen bought especially for this day
at the camp it was difficult to see anything
it seemed so safe and tranquil
he wanted to say so to the alchemist but he was afraid of the man
he waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop
he looked like an arab which was not unusual in those parts
the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
the boy went to his room and packed his belongings
first he had studied esperanto then the world's religions and now it was alchemy
but my heart is agitated the boy said
the englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story
upon returning to the wise man he related in detail everything he had seen
melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port
isn't it all too wonderful
walking along in the silence he had no regrets
they never have to make any decisions he thought
the wind's curiosity was aroused something that had never happened before
it's the oasis said the camel driver
yet each felt his heart beat a bit faster
lions hunt their prey with sprints whereas wolves take advantage of their stamina
his arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the hole
people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
don‚äôt share your opinions so readily because you never know who is listening
when he was a child that man wanted to travel too
he told me i should try to do so
it's true life really is generous to those who pursue their destiny the boy thought
the heat lasted until nightfall and all that time he had to carry his jacket
it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
the woman was silent for some time
don't say that again
they seemed to laugh at him and he laughed back his heart bursting with joy
whenever he could he sought out a new road to travel
most of them were staring quietly at the big table
i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy
i'm surprised the boy said
and above all don't forget to follow your destiny through to its conclusion
i thought you were going to teach me some of the things you know
we are part of that soul so we rarely recognize that it is working for us
and then the boy understood
he had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist
but everything had changed
the sunset faded into twilight before anything else happened
i'm not going to charge you anything now she said
everyone has his or her own way of learning things he said to himself
well why did you say that i don't know about love the sun asked the boy
then the two went off to have some more tea
there are powerful forces on both sides and the war is important to both armies
but children always seem to be able to play with them without frightening them
they're not concerned with that right now
where your treasure is there also will be your heart the alchemist had told him
it was the first time she had done that
we were all made by the same hand and we have the same soul
as the sun rose the men began to beat the boy
and he vanished around the corner of the plaza
the world speaks many languages the boy thought
i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
it had a diameter of about thirty yards
and that's where the power of love comes in
no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
but the boy never took his eye off his new friend
he called to the boy and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment
always ask an objective question
and it's not love to see everything from a distance like you do
yet it was a little too large for assurance
the boy wanted to take her hand
you dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them he said
he really was a king
did you say a king he asked
and they had understood each other perfectly well
so he could not be hasty nor impatient
i saw a young man standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again
the conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss
a lot of patience but shepherds know all about patience
but he didn't stop
it sounded like a gypsy prayer
tomorrow sell your camel and buy a horse
before him was an enormous white horse rearing over him with a frightening scream
tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself
he won't leave the circle
thank you said the boy
i was torn between fear and curiosity
the boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things
the boy was relieved
of course the two were unable to do anything
the old man knew how to read and had already read the book
we're in no hurry the chief answered
'everyone loved them and enjoyed them
the boy brought his horse closer
i am proud of you he said
there was a murmur from the crowd
that's the principle that governs all things he said
and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
and because the tribes declared war i went to the well seeking the alchemist
waste not want not
he who wronged you will hate you
writing the best memory
there was no justification provided
makes about five thousand a year
the comparison to other works on different databases is still problematic

this farm had cattle chicken sheep and many other animals
there's that reprieve if they ever find out
the shaking disturbed the rat nest
gmo are ruining our crops
where you got him
all hoses are connected to the defective hub
he felt unsafe like during his first lesson in driving school
do you mind if i wait out here
i simply can't get it to gel
it was a mega monster made of metal
the human brain is still not fully understood
we will have to run if we want to catch that bus
how many times are you gonna call me
immediately after the robbers left the bank the police were informed
this is keith miller
isn't it a little crowded
and what's the matter with a thousand dollars
your face is really beautiful
tell them mrs craig is here
you can't begin to spend all the money you've got
about three years ago i set up dragon naturally speaking on my home computer
do you know that i threw it away
james watt didn't invent the steam engine but he improved it significantly
i should say not

i could get a company doctor in twenty minutes
catherine walked alongside the canal
want to go out on it
she tried to stop the bleeding of her thighs with a tissue
what boat you sailing on
now go eat your dinner
there's not a reason on earth why you should
what's for dinner tonight
the ship appeared to be constructed with some form of chromium exoskeleton
but no one actually saw her die
you can't trust anybody in this crazy world
there were thirty girls on the soccer field
you mean the one who drank so much
she lives in the park
in the meantime i use a few different approaches

i'm getting married tomorrow

afrikaans is very similar to dutch
where do you live
now get right up on the seat there
the method does not have to be the best
i like crepes with nougat
whom are you calling now
i want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes
there is no wine in this country the young man said
i don't know how to turn them into reality
i'm an alchemist simply because i'm an alchemist he said as he prepared the meal
the shop is exactly the size i always wanted it to be
when the blinding dust had settled a bit the boy trembled at what he saw
i don't want to change anything because i don't know how to deal with change
i found these one day in the fields
he told me i should try to do so
so what is salem like he asked trying to get some sort of clue
don't give in to your fears said the alchemist in a strangely gentle voice
he also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared the sheep
in his hand he grasped a snake by the tail
he seemed unfriendly and had looked irritated when the boy had entered
he thought about asking him to give it back but decided that would be unfriendly
but the crystal merchant had no choice
when the lead had become liquid the alchemist took from his pouch the strange yellow egg
the boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question
the horseman was completely immobile as was the boy
the tribal chieftains will see that and you'll be dismissed from your position as counselor
the boy climbed the dune slowly
the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
he decided to return to his friend's stable by the longest route possible
all they wanted was food and water
i used to live near el cairum he said
it made me very depressed
you have a mania for simplifying everything answered the englishman irritated
the heat lasted until nightfall and all that time he had to carry his jacket
and their eyes spoke of death
this is the first phase of the job he said
he knew what i was thinking the boy said to himself
you are almost at the end of your journey said the alchemist
so we their hearts speak more and more softly
the stranger withdrew the sword from the boy's forehead and the boy felt immensely relieved
the gods should not have desires because they don't have destinies
your money saved us for three days
that's the principle that governs all things he said
the caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis
the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
i found myself alone and saw the people on the other side of the pit running away
the man was speaking the language of alchemy
the boy took out urim and thummim from his bag
the old man returned the book to the boy
that's the way it always is said the old man
so he began to wander through the city and found himself at the gates
it's almost as if he had been here and left his mark he thought
but as he saw them lying there on the ground another phrase came to his mind
did you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create
at other times at a crucial moment i make it easier for things to happen
but he still couldn't flee
when she saw the unknown object bobbing up and down the edge she was absolutely horrified
the boy laughed ‚äî out of happiness
toward the end of the afternoon they came upon a coptic monastery
the desert didn't answer him for a few moments
i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
i was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about what it's like to live and work there
curse the moment i met that old man he thought
why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
but in his heart he knew that it did matter
and tomorrow his enemy would also be a part of that soul
i'm going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me
we were all made by the same hand and we have the same soul
but it is not a class that was requested by our alumni or prospective students
then she again took his hands and studied them carefully
the serpent relaxed immediately
the boy remembered his dream and suddenly everything was clear to him
the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
they eat lunch together often but don‚äôt really talk outside the office
another person was there to help him toward his destiny
as he was leaving he saw in the corner of the room his old shepherd's pouch
why do you think i brought you here
you're the only one left
let's dance
just give me a few hours before you make any decisions
be sure you soap his head thoroughly
the fluid sprayed across the foyer

some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through

a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder

hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed

air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
some went away while i was there and other people came
no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed

because you'll know its dreams and wishes and will know how to deal with them
lots of places sell tea around here the merchant said
the boy told him then that he needed to get to the pyramids
and the alchemist understood that the boy's heart had returned to the soul of the world
two horsemen waiting ahead of them
did you say a king he asked
the boy looked around him at the date palms
what's the fifth obligation the boy asked
it was the levanter the wind that came from africa
he was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned
you old sorcerer the boy shouted up to the sky
i'd like to build a display case for the crystal the boy said to the merchant
the book was written in spanish
as the englishman left fatima arrived and filled her vessel with water
they were on the right track
the shop is exactly the size i always wanted it to be
they spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didn't understand any of it
the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
maybe it was because they moved around so much
he had seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands
why do they make things so complicated he asked the englishman one night
but there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing mint tea
they said nothing else
if someone isn't what others want them to be the others become angry
i could die happily and that made me feel good

he sat looking at the sky for a long time
where your treasure is there also will be your heart the alchemist had told him
we are obliged at least once in our lives to visit the holy city of mecca
there was a thud like the fall of a great mass
i kept my eyes fixed on the cylinder and began pushing my way back from the edge of the pit
the boy thought of fatima
and there were dunes rocks and plants that insisted on living where survival seemed impossible
it didn't bring with it the smell of the desert nor the threat of moorish invasion
it's called the principle of favorability
then came the night of the first falling star

they're only made of rock crystal and there are millions of rock crystals in the earth
before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
the old man returned the book to the boy
he ran his fingers slowly over the stones sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces
the englishman asked if they were in danger
henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
instead the stranger lowered it slowly until the point touched the boy's forehead
henderson was taking it in
the boy wanted to take her hand
he started to read the book he had bought
what is it you're looking for asked the old merchant
men have never understood the words of the wise
i waited all afternoon and evening he said
the woman was silent for some time
i didn't need to waste my time just for this he said
the boy put the stones in his pouch
why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
others stumbled upon the stone by accident
the day was hot and the wine was refreshing
the wind began to pick up
there is only one way to learn the alchemist answered
i had a momentary impulse to go back and help him but i was too scared to do anything
mary told me that she got to meet up with you while she was back in san francisco
don‚äôt share your opinions so readily because you never know who is listening
but if you have to go before then go on in pursuit of your dream
the old man leafed through the book and fell to reading a page he came to
he got up adjusted his clothing and picked up his pouch
he thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert
no one can be from many places the boy said
strange images passed through my mind
but if you can try to make your own decisions
and he wasn't faring much better
the shepherd swore that he would
i wanted them to be a part of your inheritance
why did you want to see me the boy asked
the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
it seemed so safe and tranquil
it was impossible to remember all the details that he covered in an hour
and that's where the power of love comes in
i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
there is a universal language understood by everybody but already forgotten
the old man said nothing
he almost began to tell about his treasure but decided not to do so
the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
it was a strange furnace fueled by firewood with a transparent flask heating on top
the boy went to his room and packed his belongings
why a revolver he asked
at once he connected the two incidents
the boy climbed the dune slowly
the dunes are changed by the wind but the desert never changes
caught it coming home from school
a boy came running towards me
maktub the boy said remembering the crystal merchant
the boy prodded them one by one with his crook calling each by name
when she saw the unknown object bobbing up and down the edge she was absolutely horrified
the monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters
the men climbed the hill and they were tired when they reached the top
he has other things to do first
can i help you asked the man behind the window
the arab accepted them without a word
we're refugees from the tribal wars and we need money the other figure said
you are wise because you observe everything from a distance the boy said
the boy knew the desert sensed his fear
who is your friend the chief asked
he walked slowly through the market
the men of the desert were already familiar with that wind
looking at the sun he calculated that he would reach tarifa before midday
it helped me to trust in people the englishman answered
what do i do in salem the old man laughed
it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
the tribal chieftain called for the boy and presented him with fifty pieces of gold
and then there were the others who were interested only in gold
and for wise men gold is the metal that evolved the furthest
i myself heard nothing of that
they could barely see the boy
the boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy but saw none
it brought his heart into his mouth
when i had my sheep i was happy and i made those around me happy
but instead of being saddened he was happy
and then they want the person to change
the alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy's cup
something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
he put a sign on the door and they went to a small cafe nearby
based on the omens of the present
and because the tribes declared war i went to the well seeking the alchemist
go and speak to the tribal chieftains said the camel driver
the boy awoke before dawn
hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
give me my book the boy said
and then he perceived it very slowly
it's called the principle of favorability beginner's luck
i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
but don't worry the alchemist continued
then suddenly they kneel and die
'everyone loved them and enjoyed them
they say it's a fake
meanwhile the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation
then taking his sheep he walked away
do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked
the boy offered his bottle hoping that the old man would leave him alone
there is no wine in this country the young man said
we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
the man looked at the angel in surprise
and eventually man will nourish your sands where the game will once again flourish
he doesn't have anything else
and he vanished around the corner of the plaza
and you've told me about omens
it was a bundle of money
just teach me to be the wind for a few moments the boy said
the three fell silent
but he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind
she would never know the difference because she didn't know how to read
they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation
so he could not be hasty nor impatient
advancing slowly they searched among the stones
he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
the other son was a poet and delighted all of rome with his beautiful verses
none of this ha d made an impression on the boy
don't try to enter into the life of the oasis
the alchemist lighted the fire and soon a delicious aroma filled the tent
they also began to feel that they knew a better way than others had
ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
the wind began to blow again
if i'm on the march i just concentrate on marching
looking up he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky
he was proud of himself
there was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the city was asleep
and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
it's not a battle of good against evil
the serpent relaxed immediately
everyone has his or her own way of learning things he said to himself
i don't think i know that one
and at that i told him and he took my place

do geese always fly in that formation
i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
that he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen
the boy was also saddened his friend was in pursuit of his destiny
all i saw was an army said the boy
it's almost as if he had been here and left his mark he thought
worked hard just to have food and water like the sheep
there was a small building there with a window at which people bought tickets to africa
but he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind
it had a diameter of about thirty yards
they are so used to me that they know my schedule he muttered
i can always go back to being a shepherd the boy thought
i'm an alchemist simply because i'm an alchemist he said as he prepared the meal
well then we've got a problem
i didn't come here to have you read my palm he said already regretting having come
he recited an our father silently
with the wars between the tribes it's impossible to cross the desert
the boy put the stones in his pouch
i'm doing much better and soon you'll be able to return to your sheep
the scabbard was embossed in silver and the handle was black and encrusted with precious stones
it is i the boy answered
it means only that the heart does what it can the alchemist said
the alchemist stopped abruptly and bent to the ground
but he kept the sword in his hand
always ask an objective question
he had understood the story the old king had told him
but as he saw them lying there on the ground another phrase came to his mind
the boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things
he thought about asking him to give it back but decided that would be unfriendly
wait for the end of the war
i have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time
one day the earth began to tremble and the nile overflowed its banks
we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
he told fatima that at their next meeting
it's the oasis said the camel driver
this is for you he said holding one of the parts out to the monk
the boy was shocked
trust in your heart but never forget that you're in the desert
that's true the boy thought
everyone when they are young knows what their destiny is
it's the emerald tablet said the englishman proud that he might teach something to the boy
most of them were staring quietly at the big table
continue in the direction of the pyramids said the alchemist
he almost began to tell about his treasure but decided not to do so
it was a strange furnace fueled by firewood with a transparent flask heating on top
he knew what i was thinking the boy said to himself
the boy began again to read his book but he was no longer able to concentrate
and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
i have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert he said
then like a colony of worker ants they dismantled their stalls and left
so you know about love the boy said
but none of that is from the pyramids said the alchemist
i have the money i need to buy my sheep
he had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist
and i'd better read your books said the boy
all they wanted was food and water
all this happened between sunrise and sunset the boy thought
you already know about alchemy
the boy noticed that the man's clothing was strange

and you've told me about omens
this is the first phase of the job he said
they're not my sheep anymore he said to himself without nostalgia
he saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes
maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is
the old man was probably a gypsy too
i've been looking for you all morning he said as he led the boy outside
they are so used to me that they know my schedule he muttered

the caravans had been stopped at giza for some time waiting for the wars to end
they must be used to their new shepherd and have probably already forgotten me
the alchemist erased the circle in the sand and the snake slithered away among the rocks

janet roger died three months ago
i'm not afraid to die
they were all standing around when she wrote it
please don't cry
you knew the whole story
where are we going
she never grew up
still can't contact conway
but the englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it
tomorrow sell your camel and buy a horse
no one said a word as the old man continued
love required them to stay with the people they loved
a friend had told the boy about the shop and he had taken his sheep there
but we could sell tea in crystal glasses
until then he had considered the omens to be things of this world
arabs often appeared in the city shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day
he condemned the commander to death without honor
his father said no more
one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
then taking his sheep he walked away
i want to see him do it said the chief
and the solid part was called the philosopher's stone
the invaders carried the name everywhere the beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride
why do they make things so complicated he asked the englishman one night
the immense collection of people and animals began to travel faster
to show you one of life's simple lessons the alchemist answered
this is for you he said holding one of the parts out to the monk
then suddenly they kneel and die
i'm doing much better and soon you'll be able to return to your sheep
he decided to return to his friend's stable by the longest route possible
and above all don't forget to follow your destiny through to its conclusion
dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
the horseman was completely immobile as was the boy
before him was an enormous white horse rearing over him with a frightening scream
all things are one the boy thought
younger man what he had seen and the man asked him to wait there
the boy trusted his new friend
he came to understand its dodges and tricks and to accept it as it was
it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
where your treasure is there also will be your heart the alchemist had told him
he seemed unfriendly and had looked irritated when the boy had entered
a friend had told the boy about the shop and he had taken his sheep there
i'm looking for a treasure said the boy and he immediately regretted having said it
he knew he was stronger than his friend
now i can see that it hasn't been too bad
the dunes are changed by the wind but the desert never changes
the tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do
just by looking at them
there was a murmur from the crowd
they were his treasure
you're looking for witch doctors he spoke some verses from the koran and moved on
well why don't we go there right now the boy asked
the day was dawning and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun
maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is
he just got a new kite for his birthday
it helped me to trust in people the englishman answered
before him was an enormous white horse rearing over him with a frightening scream
looking down at the spoon he held the boy saw that the oil was gone
he wanted to forget about the vision and return to his meditation
they wanted to save the oasis
he was able to get on his knees but he quickly slipped back
meanwhile the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation
well then why did you let me do it the boy asked
well why don't you go to mecca now asked the boy
i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
i was just in town earlier this year so it is kind of crazy to think about what took place right after
from here on you will be alone the alchemist said
because you are trying to realize your destiny
because life wants you to achieve your destiny
i've had this shop for thirty years
and there were dunes rocks and plants that insisted on living where survival seemed impossible
he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
the animals were exhausted and the men talked among themselves less and less
can i get a woot woot
the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
maybe because that wasn't really his dream
the boy waited and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted
they mounted their horses
if he makes a buying mistake it doesn't affect him much
hunches his mother used to call them
but he granted the travelers three days
the people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses
the same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip
he had been so far away that his face wasn't even visible
he thought of all the married shepherds he had known
it was better than the scent of the hookahs
as he did so he talked with the monk about the tribal wars
bakers have homes while shepherds sleep out in the open
hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
the englishman could not contain his excitement
then it became a signal of danger
sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
the treasure is at the pyramids that you already knew
but use them to buy your flock
he prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass
the city was still sleeping
so it's better to listen to what it has to say
coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
maybe that's why they give up on it so early too
the boy began to dig into the dune
it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
let's go and have some lunch said the crystal merchant
a young arab also loaded down with baggage entered and greeted the englishman
he listened to the wind and felt the stones beneath his feet
he took the fourth part and handed it to the monk
they made the boy continue digging but he found nothing
these pills do less good than others
you know what i mean
my chemist told me to take these tablets before eating
the volume wouldn't increase much further
what did it matter
it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
the octopus worried the squid
on his hands and knees
