i guess you're right
but he didn't stop
i told you to practice
you know it is
so where are we headed next
i'll bring the kids in the car
there is no letter
what are they like
so you won't blame her
there were snickers from the background
can you help me with this question
what's this the end of the eighth

maktub thought the boy
is this your wife's passport
so you combined pleasure with business
how is the climate in jamaica
i burned the omelette
the porcupine scurried home
that's a lot of hooey
i'm trying to prove it
i want to pay for my drink
it's not my house
the man wept with happiness
the boy didn't know what to say
now look what you did
just things like that
what on earth do you mean
what's in it for me
and what did you do then
between their teeth
do you want to eat first
i've had a dozen calls already
put down that chair
i want to do what i want to do
i guess you're right
the porcupine scurried home
deferred is not denied
good luck to you

have you met catherine
and you couldn't release him
the porcupine scurried home
let her come to us
what are they like
were you paid for it or weren't you
chancellor of the exchequer

so he ought to
but she has
but you could bring them there
it all happened rather suddenly
i'm on the job
where's mrs luke's box of capsules

honesty is the best policy
she said linda did it
henderson was taking it in
and that's where the power of love comes in
join the club

i'm interested only in the present
she awoke from the nightmare
too much food is being wasted
what does he do all day
go into your dance
what have i missed
we must leave now
i don't believe in voodoo
he brushed it off
give them an inch and they'll take a mile
leave no stone unturned
where is my wife
what are you looking for
i'll send you a box
the snake jetted venom
who's down there with you

i can't get hold of him
yes it would be
it also occurs on trinidad

that sobered him a little
that sobered him a little
you know it is
i'm the stranger around here
they ate in silence

i don't blame him
the first day passed
what are you talking about
that's a lot of hooey
they were relieved and happy
wish i had a million dollars
never give up
what are you doing here
what had happened to them
what are they like
what shall i do
was it a good idea

that one was my favorite
you don't know scott
that's where i'm going
i'm the stranger around here
i guess you're right
this fireplace is victorian
they can't do that to me
i left it at the office
why a revolver he asked
in a little while
something's gone wrong with the loudspeaker
let her come to us
i'm trying to prove it
that was the question
i'll talk to you tonight
people are crowded together on a street
where are we going to put him
he'll be ready on time
this was a lie and they all knew it
as fit as a fiddle

do you mean it
i want to pay for my drink
wait a minute here
what shall i do
what have i missed

a girl makes waffles in the kitchen
happy to know you
you get out of here quick
whose turn is it
that sobered him a little
i got a lot on my mind
but now i'm sad and alone
i'm beginning to like this
the first baseman dropped the ball
do you want to wake that baby
let her come to us
you hit my best friend
keep trying hard
keep trying hard
some do come back
the streamer of gas came out towards us
you jump i jump
that is really sad to here
and what did you do then
i love spicy food
i love spicy food
i don't say that
where is your father
the cake will be ready in seventeen minutes
aw man that's terrible
if that's her name
what are you doing here
i have to use the toilet
don't you want me to stay
who's gonna get him
maybe he'll give us one
they never found the secret
you mustn't let what she said bother you
now it will be with hope
she said linda did it
they never found the secret
she awoke from the nightmare
how do i feel
as was mecca for the merchant
a group of people at a restaurant
let's make a night of it
tell them to hold the wire
a man fishes on a bridge
i told you to practice
cassie dismantled the bicycle
one of the oldest trees in lincoln
what are you looking for
i'll talk to you tonight
the omens had told him so
look at what we went through today
stay where you are
i got a lot on my mind
i'll send you a box
tell them all to wait
and their eyes spoke of death
tell them to hold the wire
tell them to hold the wire
who's down there with you
an attempt to ruin us
what are you talking about
let her come to us
good luck to you
he's looking for you
they were relieved and happy
they were relieved and happy
have her call me back
they went out of business years ago
what a terrible thing to say
he believed in omens
you've got something on your mind
he slipped on the stairs
watch out blues ahead
do you want me to
we shall meet no more
pluck the bright rose without leaves
did he say anything
i respect you for it
never do it again
the little bunnies
i have the key on myself
have i offended you
i must be on my guard
i must be on my guard
was it a good idea
now it will be with hope
you know it is
was it raining last night
that sobered him a little
never do it again
here's two thousand dollars
good day to you sir
how is the climate in jamaica
what's your status
waiter king and emperor
he nodded his head
do you have anything to eat
she'll be waiting for you in albany
that sobered him a little
it's better that way
he'll be ready on time
this is christmas eve
wish i had a million dollars
they never found the secret
wait a minute here
you had me worried
then a man approached
you know i would
bottles hold four kinds of rum
and what did you do then
must try harder
so where are we headed next
when can i see him
as was mecca for the merchant
you'll find us everywhere
how did it start
give me my book the boy said
where do you think you're going
you've been doing mighty good work lately
it's better that way
where's the old goat
a puppy dog is playing with a branch
pencils down time is over
it's not my house
she awoke from the nightmare
a likely story
no olivia is a brunette
look before you leap
what are you talking about
how often has the train been late
what are you doing here
who sent you to me
don't you want me to stay
i was put to shame
try to have the court decide the case
saved us another building
where have you been for so long
he nodded his head
a group of women having a discussion
where's your coat and hat
the night was warm and i was thirsty
where'd you get it
i guess you're right
i'll send you a box
i hope it works
between their teeth
saved us another building
would you do anything like that
the gala was fun
there is nothing wrong with it
don't point the gun at me
how often has the train been late
could i please see you a minute
i'd better hustle him up
i'm not afraid to die
are there any other questions
maktub thought the boy
in a little while
and their eyes spoke of death
and their eyes spoke of death
high seats are best for football fans
it was an oblong shape
no more tickets left
like when you go into a drugstore
let her come to us
priya was late to class
you've got swell form
here's two thousand dollars
i don't want to rush you
they returned to the gates of the monastery
they were relieved and happy

jane spoke emphatically
what does it mean
we couldn't make it in a week
we rolled the log over the hill
i'll be back in a minute
i looked at her
what had happened to them
what had happened to them
bottles hold four kinds of rum
i shall not feel it at all

kirsten shrugged her shoulders
there is nothing wrong with it

three taps is me
the interface was indecipherable

the families will be here soon
i left it at the office
i'd better hustle him up
what are you looking for
now it will be with hope
i watched the weather forecast
the cup handle has broken

the omens had told him so
general levy of the people
her eye twitched uncontrollably
my mother is a lesbian
that sobered him a little
anywhere to get away from that wrangling
let's make a night of it
she looks kind of bored
not what you'd call rich
i don't know how to explain it
i'm beginning to like this
will it rain tomorrow
no one seemed to have thought about it that night
but none of that mattered to the alchemist
we're in no hurry the chief answered
i got a continuance for a whole month

what are you doing here
you'll find us everywhere
an unhappy woman walks down the street
we heard a lot of yelling
what's in it for me
that's the best part of it
everything i say is right
an onion a day keeps everyone away
whose turn is it
i was expecting you
another hour to write it
coach has heard all about you
why a revolver he asked
a man hiking his way in the snow
his name is barry baldwin
handle that with kid gloves

the boy closed his book
the boy closed his book

a ghostly figure appeared
nothing venture nothing gain

this is the press room
i'm interested only in the present
the bunch of grapes was pressed into wine
look fireflies

what does he do all day
nothing venture nothing gain
where's your coat and hat
i don't think i follow you
drop the whole business quickly
he can't hurt anybody
the electrician looked puzzled
canada is quite cold at times
my name's heather
what are you talking about
and then the boy understood
is prophecy playing at malco theatres
if you lose your temper don't look for it
i'll be back in a minute
you two in the last row stop giggling
it is about by in plan
dispense with a vest on a day like this
court chaplain i thank you
o holy night

what a wonderful weather
a silhouette of a man with a fishing pole
that's a lot of hooey
the shepherd swore that he would
the night was warm and i was thirsty
they went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery
just like the old days
whose turn is it
that wasn't at all necessary
in a little while
in a little while
the boy knew a lot of people in the city
there is too much at stake
a woman in a red dress walking
the first baseman dropped the ball
what do you make of him
his name is barry baldwin
on the street where you live
she said linda did it
what a terrible thing to say
you're here rather early
now you listen to me
bless you
jerry could not believe it
theory and computation
foxes are uncommon where i'm from
did you see the new documentary
the dead have no friends
you mistake me for another
i feel it all over me
and your aunt
i love chocolate candies
i want to become a restaurateur
he broke a new shoelace that day
how long will you be away
she decided against it
it was located on a shallow river crossing
i didn't know what to do
no that is not a good solution
that one was my favorite
didn't you put any soda in it
do you have anything to eat
my friend bought all the other sheep immediately
the child almost hurt the small dog
the porcupine scurried home
mind if i sit down
a quart of milk is water for the most part
i can see the billboards now
a woman climbing a mountain
some do come back
you know i'd tell you if i had it
how is the climate in jamaica
this was a lie and they all knew it
he's nuts about you
are there any other questions
it's better that way
would you do anything like that
her hair flowed down her back
they found two new dimples
i don't know who anybody is any more
i'd better hustle him up
if you are well off remain so
i don't want to be city sealer
many people decide it 's time to eat
then a man approached
he told them all to be seated
i wish they'd take me back and hang me
a man is walking into a building
do you want to wake that baby
what's your name he asked
the plastic carrier bag had torn
the hogs were fed chopped corn and garbage
optimism is the key to a happy life
he's looking for you
but he didn't stop
you hit my best friend
the boy closed his book
tomorrow at this same time bring me a tenth of your flock
her jaw was getting tired from chewing gum
the boy didn't know what to say
the boy didn't know what to say
don't let them get away
what does he do all day
but i'm not through complaining yet
bless you
she's a wonderful person
was it a good idea
don't put all your eggs in one basket
the hell you say it's all right
general levy of the people
you mistake me for another
knowledge is better than riches
knowledge is better than riches

a gray mare walked before the colt
that one was my favorite
i call it my garden

do you have nina's phone number
you'll find us everywhere
where's my insurance policy
i can see the billboards now
what do you make of him
he'll be ready on time

that party was amazing
it was better than the scent of the hookahs
you don't have to wait till january
no more tickets left
we are all getting older and nothing is forever
jeez you look stoned
we've existed since time began
the men at the bar were obviously drunk
i'll have the paper send the money right down to you
you hit my best friend
wish i had a million dollars
if bill had died in bed we wouldn't even have him
she said with chattering teeth
spirit animation spirited
where is my wife
you get out of here quick
you can't desert now
nothing's going to happen
jeez you look stoned
i have a confession to make
look fireflies
it was immediately apparent
of course i believe you
i'd like to do that
the shepherd swore that he would
give me my book the boy said
the sun began its departure as well
our clothes are dry
men with fireworks on street
you jump i jump
what do you mean
yes that will do
he was bisexual i think
i don't think i follow you
why didn't i come home for supper
that's the best part of it
just like the old days
good luck to you
that's what makes it romantic
her hair flowed down her back
this fireplace is victorian
jane spoke emphatically
it was immediately apparent
why don't we tear the building down
where's mrs luke's box of capsules
always in a hurry always behind
he said he couldn't have handled it better himself
make sure you get a doctor's note
i watched the weather forecast
eighteen of us couldn't move the van
i got a lot on my mind
the boy knew a lot of people in the city
not every part was in germany and japan
maybe he'll give us one
hasty judgements are generally faulty
that woman stole my purse
wish i had a million dollars
can't you give me another hour
they never found the secret
nostalgia isn't what it used to be
the ladder on the fire truck was not long enough
i must speak to my lawyer
that is really sad to here
the old pan was covered with hard fudge
all cats are grey in the dark
rules are made to be broken
the plush chair leaned against the wall
open your book to the first page
i can't find the ruler in my pencil case
where is your father
we need reproducible research
the toll bridges scan all license plates
he was cold and distant
have i offended you
what if we all joined forces
they took the axe and the saw to the forest
he sat up with a jerk
put down that chair
are you certain it's not a monster
another hour to write it
i've got to decorate my tree
can you lend me your bycicle for a while
goats always have a better view
he slipped on the stairs
i came out of it without a scratch
how do people celebrate good weather over there
there was no excuse for goodman to fly off the handle
it's not my house
i'm interested only in the present
it was a bill for a hundred and twenty pounds
i can't do it
have a good sleep honey
aw man that's terrible
okay that seems fair
how do i feel
put down that chair
i never said i'd take it
my mother is a lesbian
need a table for 2 in kuwait
he's the man the ads are written for
you hit my best friend
and don't forget to make him wear his raincoat in london
i'd better hustle him up
so you won't blame her
if you are well off remain so
the night was warm and i was thirsty
the boy smiled to himself
do you know when you're really lonely
that sobered him a little
you know where she lives
clementine is longsighted
and their eyes spoke of death
i don't blame him
i'm on the job
i'm beginning to like this
no he had not
love required them to stay with the people they loved
the cup handle has broken
a couple dances while a man sings
we've existed since time began
we've existed since time began
it was located on a shallow river crossing
coed choir singing at an event
maybe he'll give us one
he could always become a crystal salesman again
he could always become a crystal salesman again
you know very well why
and then the boy understood
that's the main idea
that woman stole my purse
wish i had a million dollars
i'm trying to prove it
goats always have a better view
henderson was taking it in
they never found the secret
person with red shirt and black pants climbing a rock
if he ever decided to leave them they would suffer
the boy didn't know what to say
they went out of business years ago
it was immediately apparent
mayday we crashed into an iceberg
that was the question
happy to know you
i am unable to join you tomorrow
there is a lag between thought and act
lima is the capital of peru
for a moment no one spoke
for a moment no one spoke
if you are well off remain so
a miss is as good as a mile
draw the chart with heavy black lines
could you give me a piece of bread please
please don't be concerned
pluck the bright rose without leaves
trees are made into many things
trees are made into many things
before you go i want to hug you she said
it looks like lena left her jacket
the junk yard had a mouldy smell
pencils down time is over
thank you for your understanding
the lord loveth a cheerful liar
what is it like
welcome dear friends
it was very hard for her to focus
i have a confession to make
the top had certainly ceased to rotate
i don't know that
do not cross the yellow line
that's the best part of it
a man a gun and a dog
marry in haste repent at leisure
before you go i want to hug you she said
what's your name he asked
let's have your story
oh no call the fire brigade
i bet she's pregnant
breathe deep and smell the piny air
i raised one of mine
it is no longer fit for purpose
a lame back kept his score low
she loved the color mauve
he clutched the thatch
the electrician looked puzzled
i was put to shame
who's down there with you
but then i realized she couldn't have been
i'll do anything you say
i'll bring the kids in the car
the men fell into an animated discussion
