how did he look
dont be a fool
i dont mean that
what shall we do
good evening

silence gives consent
you're there are you
i cannot tell you
the door was open
i didn't do anything
why not right here
and he gets it right away

it'd be too late
gentlemen of the press

would you mind seeing me to the door
enough said the boy
one that will write
i'd like to think
anything i can do back here
and so do i
i've done nothing of the sort
i dont mean that
i had a memo from art today
i'm proud of you
who gets your vote
i own my own house
where'd you meet this man
this guy stole my watch
i guess i've seen everything now
we want to see you
who says i can't
i'm sure of it
what is today
what did he say
what do you want of me
is it not so
what did they say
who would have thought that
what did he say
may i see it
have a good trip
how about that check
i won't shut up
i need a break
do i knock or something
there was a long pause
don't you like her
we wiped the board
what time is it
i'd like to live in it
that was his work
you want the moon
how can you tell
let me talk to him
i can't do that
i never had any such idea
come out of there
i tore him apart
the alchemist turned to the boy
don't worry about that
we'd better forget it
come on in here now
but he's on the right track
is there anything i can do for you
are you john doe
i'm going to them
thanks for dropping around
don't you like her
and that's another thing
this was too much
may i go in and see him
they'll take care of it
now the moon's out
i was impatient to see it opened
but i didn't kill anybody
i used to pitch
how'd you get out
but i sort of like him
what are you doing in here
i like gentle people
why do you ask
i'll show those guys
you can hear out of it
we'll find you a hotel
it came about in this way
you can't stay here
now how'd you know that
we'd better exchange keys
that man is terrific
with a bag of marshmallows
you'll have to wake him up
and then i'm going to build things
what have you done with them
why didn't they wake me
thank god for that
but he is right
now attend to me
how do you mean
may i see it
what did i tell you
i stared at him
what are you listening to
i should say so
i couldn't go back

what's going on here
the idea is still good
i'm playing for keeps

how do you feel
if i know where she is
we took all the chances
you may kiss my hand
harry'll tear his dinner suit
give her the works
i don't know what she's talking about
she took care of bobby for us
it's coming right over
it was a bundle of money
i was impatient to see it opened
that's a good idea
a friend of yours
you ought to know that
i want it as soon as possible
how can i thank you
what is it tom
what's the matter with you
storm and stress
quiet down will you
good morning how are you
what do you want
hey don't go there
i don't know what to do
what could it mean
how would he take it
oh i beg your pardon
what do you want here
put jackie right on the staff
get martin out of jail
it shall be done
sal is good at running
what did you have
the boy preferred wine
where do you come from
listen to that mob
it drew a droplet of blood
it was linda keller
you know where i live
many of our soldiers teamed up
give her the works
you have been a real blessing to me
what could i do
i won't let you
i should have repeated it for him
the boy was getting irritated
it wasn't there
a touch of colic
have you ever tried
he just took over the bank
i'll give you a break
are you going to call me
who is your favorite artist
what's the matter with him
you mean the one who drank so much
one of my best reporters
the poem was great
i've been trying to figure it out
and this is your coat
i like gentle people
how'd you get in here
hope you enjoy it
i done my best
the boy was becoming nervous
the pat anthony party
thank heaven you're here
the beer tasted really good
did you give her the money
oh i think you are right
i can't quite hear you
but what does it mean
sitting of the delegates
what is she to do
what are you thinking of
what does he do
it's freezing outside
how long have i been here
as you wish
what did he want
what if he made a new version
nor was it
the safe's empty
what's the matter
sift the evidence
and what are you doing here
did you see him
you don't look yourself
and so it does
how do you feel
i'm sure you haven't any
have a good trip
and it goes for you too
is it a deal
you been in a fight
and i think it's terrific
where was his horse
so what does he do
they'd never let you go
the letter ain't worth nothing
throw it in the bin
hang on for a second
i'm surprised you didn't run into her
starting with his own
this is for the boy
now that's too much
the cottage burned down
my laptop has crashed
if i told you it might not come true
have we forgotten anything
what's all this mess
one of my best reporters
they always do that
what did he do
of course there is
she sends for you
symbols of the little people
calibration complete
did you speak to mr norton
i thought that was peter parker
not a word was said
what are the facts
read some books won't you
could i borrow a bit of cash
terracotta sighing
why do you do it
will you hear it
get out of this
i shall be a riot
what can we do
may i sit down
what did he look like
every man has his price
yes that's not bad
do you see her
he's on the way
i don't believe it
i didn't do it
i saw him get it
the package has been flagged as outdated
they continued across the desert
i want those stamps
bye for now
i gave you fifty just the other day
come out of there
don't do it for me
i'm dying for what i believe
i'll tell you something more
it is i the boy answered
then he may be caught on a ledge
let me out of here
don't talk too loud
he learned swimming in school
he learned swimming in school
the boy thought of fatima
but he's on the right track
they jumped out of the window
topsy turvy steamboat
he's already killed three men
what do you mean by that
now look what you've done
but they could never have taught him arabic
do i knock or something
starting with his own
maybe they're like me
good morning
he won't leave the circle
we need to run
this is no place for you
i thought you were asleep
there was a murmur from the crowd
where did he keep his money
somebody call the police
you need to see this
why can't you be serious
i think maybe you'd better
she knows it too
not even a stick of gum
sun is better than rain
that's got nothing to do with it
never mind the money
look at those shoulders
just think of it
what's in that desk
i don't blame them
i beg your pardon
have a good look
wear the blue one
send those other people in
what time is it
the briefing room was abandoned
let's go hiking across france
it's coming right over
it's coming right over
then i don't get paid
it's easy for you to talk
thank you said the boy
not on your life
its lower end was still embedded
his name is welch
but i didn't kill anybody
there's the professor now
i'll hang it up
i'd like to live in it
that's not my money
but you want to know something
they have searched it thoroughly
my father fell in love with him
you haven't seen anything yet
then who's this one
and what a way to quit
we'll be down with the bags in a minute
i'll show those guys
we returned to the cemetery
don't argue with me here
it isn't too late
i can't imagine who did it
she'll be all right
there must be some mistake
perhaps she forgot all about it
just what is the lowdown on williams
i almost dropped him
i'm a sucker for it
i'll see you after
of course it is
he's right in my office there
it isn't the money
what's that got to do with it
something terrible's happened to me
maybe that's why they came
i'll go further than that
and so do you
mine's in the door
i won't hurt you
i won't hurt you
how do you like her
i've got to see nicole right away
why didn't they wake me
he did not look up
nothing to be seen
sound as a bell
we shall be in time
not if i know it
let me help you guys
what was i to do
how did it happen
you are quite right
and he flung up his hands
why don't you speak
she made no reply
what do you know about him
do you like fruit
nothing of the kind
i stared at him
i can prove it
what can i do for you
i have heard so
you mean about the man
i don't know yet
now i must go
now i must go
the least you can do is call nine one one
what could it mean
be right there boss
be right there boss
who told you that
have you the key
baked earth
i guessed as much
you know her then
that goes without saying
what did he grow
i'm in no hurry
i'm in no hurry
i don't believe you
very well very well
we will not keep you here
what do you think of that
what does that mean
he had a chip on his shoulder
just as i thought
so far so good
i think that is all
how much will it cost
then he stood up
then she looked up
what good would that do
a bat is in the cave
why did you tell me
there was a pause
no i don't say that
what would you do
quit whining
oh that's too bad
cattle plague
what do you know about him
what can you do
i've got to go to him
get out of here
why not right here
what's done is done
have you ever tried
they always do that
you will need some rubber boots
keep your shirt on
are you sure this is claire
what's wrong with that one
you don't know who did it
you mean here in the city
but what could he do
the one in there
i can't do that
want to give my flower a drink
have you got that money
they have their eyes glued on his face
if you want it you must take it
did you get it
i've got to go
didn't you know that
think about that
so far so good
is it a good job
you like every boy
that's what she said the last time
i should have been there
is that what you want me to tell vincent
grandma is fearless
yeah i'll look in to it
he told his story
and how did you get out
a man of one book
how do we know it's really over
ta very much
do you want me
what can have happened
very well she said
do you hear me
how could i help it
will that suit you
do you read me
we must stay hidden
you are what you eat
we wiped the board
that's not so bad
it's up to you
you told me that
there is a way out
break this crowd up
what are you afraid of melissa
what do they want
i'm proud of it
what would you say about that
cashier's got your check
was that question rhetorical
which view would you like
it stands to reason
well we shall see
but you've got to leave me alone
i knew it
sunday will not work for me
do you like fruit
i can't swim
hey don't go there
not in a month of sundays
how could i help it
what are we to do
where are you going
it is all right
can you tell me
what could i do
are you in the book
we need to run
don't mind the colonel
now what do you say
the quicker the better
her records were incomplete
who is it from
i'm smoking too much
we dont want him
he's on the telephone
don't say those things
i didn't have it
no i have not seen it
don't press the red button
the wind began to pick up
the boy preferred wine
is the head better
and he gave the boy his blessing
you're a newspaper man
i'd like to think
we were in the same outfit
i passed away in it
then stop acting like one
we must stay hidden
it's a good face
the meeting was over
there are a lot of seats over there
they said nothing else
she reversed the charges
that's all you are
then came a war
many telescopes were pointed at it
what could it mean
i don't blame them
aren't you allowed to kiss back
who's the ten for
i want to look at my flower
it was a bundle of money
i didn't know whose it was
how came you here
that sounds like their problem
what would i have to say
i'm in no hurry
c'mon over and join our party
i know what you're feeling
how are you doing
but that's what they gave me
the boy smiled and continued digging
what's that book you've got there
my phone is in my back pocket
it isn't too late
there must be some way
let them come in
we need to hurry
the book was written in spanish
why can't you get along with her
did you give her the money
we didn't steal it
she wrote the stuff
it means my job
we went to the beach to sunbathe
the three fell silent
don't be a fool
what should we give him
but they were engaged
where is it then
she wasn't her type
the music was captivating
of course we do
it looks like it
he shook his head
bye for now
the boy shook his head
but enough of this
not very quick
down on his luck
acceleration of time
take care of yourself
that's what's the matter
why have you come here now

i am all attention
when did you get back
they're going to believe that one
what do you say to that
what did it matter

betty was surprised
i'm just a fool
i haven't any hard feelings
what's the matter with eleanor

how much do you want
what is she to do
what do you mean to do
what's the matter with you
quiet down will you
but what are we to do
but how can you be sure

what did he do
i'm quite all right
not giving it his full mind

the wide road shimmered in the hot sun
the packaging was broken
but then he stopped
it was linda keller
the smoker cleared his lungs of phlegm
raisins are delicious
it was aligned perfectly
the clock was slightly askew
capital town
and don't bump into anything

the boy listened quietly
i've been all over town
they're recognizing great britain
my calendar was full that month

woman falling off her rollerblades
i'm at the end of my rope
i'll get it for you
isn't it just beautiful
we should meet some day
somebody call the police
you need to see this

but the boy couldn't even speak
it picks up on the mike
i can help him
how much is it worth
he got up early with the idea of finding it
stand by to contact amanda

a breeze began to blow

i beg your pardon
everybody knows you're a sweetheart
you don't have to sign anything
how about some wine

i'd like to take a bath

his name is welch
the emergency team came quickly
what did you do it for
she improved her list every day
what do you do when you work
they voted carlos down

he could not help it
divide and conquer

and when they do i get mad
he's been crying for five minutes

thanks for dropping around
i want to leave this with you
what's she doing over here
we wiped the board
turkey for thanksgiving
can you tell me where it hurts
whom are you calling now
there was no trace of him
the same is true for animals
they always do that
he couldn't have been wrong
i'm glad you gentlemen are here
just as i thought
what's wrong with that
there must be somebody there
why do you think i brought you here
i never had
who wouldn't be
i need to mow the grass
is he a drunkard or what

writing the best memory
weave the carpet on the right hand side
pizza is an italian classic
we could be liable
i thought you would be pleased with them

where'd you wire him
what's the matter with you
i could have helped her
do you understand me
i'll take that bet
i'll take mine now
i do not know
i always have been
take hold of the cover
what's he doing here
the one you're blocking
aren't we godlike
did you get a doctor
where are they gone
they're closing in on you
you keep out of this
the boy was shocked
can i get a woot woot
i didn't have it
it is i the boy answered
i think i will
i think i will
i've heard her speak of you
gives you an idea of the season
i've got a desk i want moved
you're not fooling anybody
i'm sure you haven't any
i never said any such thing
do you see this
over here in the bushes
catherine walked alongside the canal
you go on and practice
i'm afraid you put them on too early
where will you go
what do you know about miranda
an act of faith
that's what i'd like to know
he fondled his bright orange beard
will you do that for me
where did he keep his money
why didn't you deliver them right away
do you know what i mean
that is all i have to say
that's not so bad
that might be all right
you did a swell job
a touch of colic
and that's another thing
do you understand what it means
and he told what he had seen
please don't make me
you've forgotten my milk
better let me talk to him
where'd you get this
i couldn't work in the city
what are you doing tonight
you bet i will
thank you said the boy
you know you did
they always do that
and it knew nothing about love
that's true the boy thought
you're hurting my sore foot
did you finish the interview
wait till martha hears about this
i'll be right back
what did he ever do for his country
what's the idea here
he wasn't asking for help
big fish eat little fish
a man plays music to a crowd of people
let me see it
did you get a doctor
you're just like father used to be
the boy was becoming nervous
help the weak to preserve their strength
what's its value today
please go to aisle seven
she never grew up
the car engine has seized
it receded into the hole
then leave with the caravan
i never saw it before
i'm used to it
now listen to me
collateral of any kind
i didn't want the publicity
i said good night
by letting me help you
did you bring the christmas wreath
there was no response from the elders
the boy shook his head
he had repaired an omission
it would be useless
it would be useless
as hard as nails
will you come with me
i'm sure of it
why don't you speak
so much the better
feynman
not in the least
live and learn
i turned upon her
did you check your laser
you are what you eat
but what can i do
but what can i do
what a wonderful day
i have previously read the book
it was of no use
hey don't go there
they are lifting her out
there's nothing in it
so he did return
i have it here
it was towering over us
to go to the dogs
i'm in no hurry
i'm in no hurry
i wish to see her
but it was too late
do i know it
oh that will be fun
where are they now
the balloon rose into the air without her
that was all right
it just describes him
what do you think it was
that's the spirit
is that okay
please bring soap
go on my friend
pride feels no pain
do you hear me
i don't know where to go
have you seen him
what on earth are you doing
what does that get us
he's on the way
i knew you would come
it was a juggernaut
do you know what i mean
we can't leave greg here
i like the way she talks
undefined
full circle
what can i do now
this is keith miller
look at it today
what is the matter
has he been here
milkshake is best in its chocolate form
you can't do that to me
he's in my room
please give me my robe
are you enjoying london
we want to see you
thank heaven you're here
it's got to be somewhere
what do you need
did you give her the money
we broke it in half
she wasn't her type
twins are known to be confounding
the hell you say
wait till we get home
we're all excited around here
practice makes perfect
i'm sending james over to see you
but he still couldn't flee
the train pulled into the station
well then stand up
but would you mind telling me who goes out
that's what i am
what difference does that make
but don't take my word for it
why are we doing this again
oh you are eh
did you see any ghosts
good morning how are you
i told her so
how do you know it
how bad can a boss be
the nearer the bone the sweeter the meat
the same noise
peace came years after the war
you weren't nervous
i'll do it
let us satisfy her
i only know the refrain
are you in pain
punk was never my type of music
why don't you say something
very well she said
where do you live
how far is it
it's good to see you
do you understand that
is it for humans
afraid it might rain
you'd better take it easy
and i'd like to have it
and he gets it right away
then what did you do
the boy's name was santiago
big multicolored balloons
i thought sure you'd remember me
that's exactly what i thought
imperial diet
what's the matter with my brain
why can't she get along with me
the boy preferred wine
they'd never let you go
just by looking at them
shall i pray for him
i'm going with you the boy said
we'd better forget it
what's the matter with you
get out of the way
get out of the way
his father said no more
and i'll sign a paper
it'll be for life
what do you want here
what do i know about that
it was about you
and will we go places
about one in twenty
it'd be too late
all's well that ends well
have you ever been to singapore
i ain't gonna squeal
two girls wrapped in a blanket
just like an organ
are you in the book
he just got a new kite for his birthday
i'm afraid you're blocking my view
don't you know me
now what are you going to do
they said nothing else
the terror was palpable
the terror was palpable
kate frank's a baker
i'll get it for you
lioness rushes to defense of cub
it was a juggernaut
it brought his heart into his mouth
thought i might be hearing from you
that doesn't happen to just anyone
you don't mean it
sodium chloride is just common table salt
wait for the end of the war
it's not so bad
it's awfully clear now
the cottage burned down
we can't leave greg here
the teller didn't have enough change
you've passed me on the street almost every day
what is my function
now go eat your dinner
see if you can get us seats near the umbrellas
what's he doing here
i'll tell you in a minute
of course it's the place
what do you mean she can't get away
in my mind's eye
do you mind if i wait out here
how could it be awkward
it's the only name i've got
it's like a plague
there was no other baggage
that sounds like their problem
wouldn't do any good
i do the best i can to help
thanks ever so much for the bag
i'm the answer to your prayer
do you see that
i'm not doing it for you
keep your shirt on
i feel fine now
it's gonna put our city on the map
she and heather were talking
don't argue with me here
it has happened many times before
i should say not
maybe he really is a fool
he's home cooking dinner
the doctor says it's nothing serious
just what i said
the idea frightened him
they both spoke the same language
there is nothing the matter with me
i don't want mrs douglas
it's still sopping wet
i'll see you after
the wind has many names
of course it is
you know what i mean
just as a rule of thumb
i've got to get katie out of jail
the toilet needed cleaning
and you can quote me on that
she never grew up
she has chipped a fingernail

she wrote the stuff
but this'll teach them a lesson
i think i got a date
i think i got a date
there's been an accident

he shrugged his shoulders
you can get them for me

never mind the european war
that's what i'm going to do
that's what i'm going to do
have you notified the police
the boy was shocked
the boy was shocked
tell nathan to get on the extension
i can't quite hear you

love sees no faults
it looks like it

a magistrate
he consulted his watch
long live the king
there was a long silence
i beg your pardon
there was a silence
this was too much
nor was it
we need more soap

what else could it be
i spent all day in the park
these are forces of change
it is a freehold house

capital town
the noise came from the basement
i had that right here
that's what i'd like to know
maybe we're all that way the boy mused
look where you're going
look at that face
he'll drive you batty
they mounted their horses
you told me that
i shouldn't think so
you like every boy
thank you so much for your contribution
where she used to live
the window opened outward
i think you're a great guy
look around some time
we have that all figured out
where was his horse
i dont mean that
do you know those people
you are what you eat
then he turned to the boy
then he turned to the boy
did you get it
it brought his heart into his mouth
what your husband was mixed up in
two cents worth of shoelaces
march was windy and dark
wait for the end of the war
i'd hate to have that many pins stuck in me
i'd like to take a bath
somebody's going to get hurt
the sheep had taught him that
but what is the use of talking
what is the matter
a dog playing in the grass
she could still be alive
symbols of the little people
your father's had a stroke of luck
did you see it
of course you never did
do you know him
can we talk tomorrow
what have you done
set the name of the user logging in
what did he want
they conquered their fear
to add insult to injury
is it raining right now
i'm not hungry i'm starving
and what are you doing here
what is it boss
can it be changed
what are you going to do sir
how do you feel
what do you know about that
let's see the money
how much does this cost
he asked for him
it was an element of her sexuality
i didn't do anything
as nice as blake's
might start to rain again
what's done is done
aren't you going to tell me
what your husband was mixed up in
your account's still here
close shot of the colonel
a friend of yours
but they were not there
he's in my room
how should i know
get this car out of here
i know she writes them
how do you feel
now it turns out you were only interested in the money
let me speak to her
what do i know about that
which view would you like
i never said any such thing
topsy turvy steamboat
the letter from kelsey jane
what am i to do with it
that's a fair amount of loot
listen to the woman
i thought you were gone
there was a murmur from the crowd
i've got to go
the monk was irritated
you've got the money
that might be all right
it was a litmus test
i guess i used all the shells
there was no other baggage
it looked like a rusty gas float
let me see it
it infuriates me and i don't know why
because they're still here
you don't rub the baby dry
i've already told you
he's after the money
chickens are adorable
play music through groove shark
you left out number five
time turn over
i won't say anything

delete this file
spencer of the chronicle
must have been a kid
you're far too valuable
enough said the boy
it was linda keller
just like an organ
what have you got to report
you can't get her on the phone
somebody call the police
a touch of colic
she just called me
you've forgotten my milk
i'll stop him cold
what is the matter
i like ice cream
a home with father
the plastic barrier shattered
we don't use money in heaven
hope you enjoy it
i think i got a date
picture's in the paper
you'd better get your friends
what are you doing up here then
i'm playing for keeps
doesn't that make sense
no sense in going up there
i thought i'd buy them some groceries
yes or even search for treasure
how much do you want
is that the contract
can i get a woot woot
haven't you even started
i don't know about war
isn't it a little crowded
several figures approached him
putting the cart before the horse
give me my robe
the alchemist turned to the boy
i wish you'd let me help you
it was a very warm october
there ain't any more
i forgot my hat
and stop threatening that boy
i'm sure you haven't any
you're supposed to be a smart guy
i came over with johnny
there's millions of ways
and i'm going to build things
they're going to believe that one
it occurred to me late last night
gentlemen of the press
so now i'm a camel driver
judge may not think so
judge may not think so
we must stay hidden
a country estate
good morning
what did i tell you
i thought you were asleep
they were kissing in the backyard
i'll kill both of them
what have you got to report
this is my last chance
how do you think i got here
would you rather leave
i did what i could
grandpa hasn't called me for days
do you know me
i've got to go
i don't believe it
take your paws off me
i'm not gonna talk about them
why don't you want me to see him
hey don't go there
that's not so bad
i'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this
i got ways of making them talk
why are you blaming me
this is mr zach carter
i have already found my treasure
what could it mean
it's just that i never have
how long since we've seen each other
i know everything about you
please don't make me
when did you arrive in town
acne is mainly a problem for teenagers
i forgot you were here
it's practically up there now
whom are you calling now
that's never happened to me the boy said
what's the matter with eleanor
now what do you say
and to do that you need money
he's trying to trick you again
i have it here
it's coming right over
i guess i was homesick
thank you said the boy
your account's still here
the boy was surprised at his thoughts
i've seen guys like you go under before
i was impatient to see it opened
she knows everything
will you help me
children jumping in puddles
what is the matter
i wish they were rabbits
they know it was an accident
the boy fell to his knees and wept
i know what you're feeling
it start with one thing
but he'd have to
august may have ended early
keep your shirt on
i'm just too miserable
he nodded and said nothing
but i don't have it
maybe he really is a fool
i wouldn't want to use that tub
only we call them agents
afraid it might rain
i want my wife
phone the newspapers
what's going on here
the speech will continue
i'm your guardian angel
she comes by it naturally
the boy laughed  out of happiness
do you know him
oh they're laughing at me
where'd you get that belt
she joined up too
with a bag of marshmallows
the three fell silent
and here's fifty dollars on account
you can't believe it's not butter
why didn't you say something
how'd you happen to fall in
quit whining
i said good night
by letting me help you
it took her a while to get used to it
the music was captivating
why are you not at work
i'm playing for keeps
my chinchilla eats bread
he shook his head
not very quick
open the window
the transaction is still pending
out of sight out of mind
what is it that i tell you
greediness burst the bag
you are quite right
the trunk of a statue
mow the lawn
i could not bear it
of course i dont think so
nor was this all
he made her another bow
tomorrow is a new day
what am i to do with it
a country estate
what did it matter
i'm at home
what can i do for you
wine is not an emulator
what will happen to him
call a spade a spade
as like as two peas
that is the question
he consulted his watch
where did you find that apple
where did you find that apple
can anyone hear me
hey don't go there
that is all i have to say
the old man left the book
what will you have to drink
the rest are studio cuts
for donkeys' ages
what are you going to do with me
how did you get in before
is it a secret
it is in front of his house
this story is absolutely terrific
great can you show them to me
you ought to know
the photo had a hue
but here is news for us
madame had been very good to me
then he went in
aren't we godlike
don't go off half cocked
i'll catch a bus
what is the matter
one egg is like another
business before pleasure
this is an ultralight case
her lips ready for the kiss
he pinched her cheek
i did not know
what should she tell him
nice genial jolly
what could it be
it was too late
a man's house is his castle
seize the day
why are you doing this
no of course not
i am going to asia tomorrow
i am not a vegetarian
then she looked up
might i use your phone
couple of hours after
he looked at his watch
i should think not
dont you like it
there was a pause
what did you think of that trip
i only know the refrain
and so it does
then she has recovered
sure i will be right back
you do not think he is ill
why are you not at work
what do you want of me
why did you do it
get up we're going shopping
mommy can we have a puppy please
did you make a speech
i won't shut up
i don't see a thing
what day is it
the insurance was sky high
two dogs play with a bottle
the briefing room was abandoned
this definitely works well
are you sure you're comfortable
a child jumps off a slide
get some water quickly
doug's a good friend of mine
how'd you get in here
can you get in this desk
not with my money
and will i tell ray
words can hurt very much
how should i know
i knows i'm a luxury
it's a simple story
she wrote the stuff
it wasn't much anyway
i won't say anything
she must have known alex pretty well
are you a real cowboy
it was aligned perfectly
april cuddled her lamb
i don't think i know that one
i stared at him
don't you like her
where did he keep his money
what will happen to him
eight young women perform a cheerleading dance on a court
the old man left the book
turkey for thanksgiving
what is my function
is it all right
i know you're unhappy
to lead a cat and dog life
what did he grow
i beg of you not to do this thing
try it again
thank you very much
it looked like a rusty gas float
i'm going away he said
sam's crazy about mick
are you coming tomorrow
this picture is pure art
it was an old car
just what i said
are you on the guest list
will no one go
what do you need
i don't blame you
i was just asking
you'll ask me to what
i guess they just can't help it
read all about it
grayhaired man with glasses
what can i do
she's gonna like it isn't she
i need to go to the emergency room
what is your name
what does he look like
what is it then
there was a long pause
why do you do it
what's all this about a necklace
we didn't get the necklace
do you have isabella's phone number
what else could it be
very well very well
lack of appetite
i felt the same
one good turn deserves
what would you do
familiarity breeds contempt
what have you got there
right back at you
don't talk too loud
i'm getting trevor ready
over here in the bushes
what have i done
a surfer surfs
hey what do you say
it's the only answer
are you sure they are not all there
the boy was getting irritated
i've got to go
that might be all right
you've got to do something
but i like it that way
how about that one there
you ought to know
the whole army of them
a fine bunch of reporters
i should have been there
play lastfm
how should i know
an appeal to john doe
that's what i am
i think you're a great guy
there's been an accident
i've got a flash for you
it wasn't much anyway
what are you doing there
don't you see what's happening
i'm feeling too good
don't say those things
glad he took the t out of that
isn't it a little crowded
do you mind if i sit down
i never had any such idea
but he decided to take a chance
no one attacks an oasis
listen to that mob
and he gave the boy his blessing
your heart is alive
he should respect tradition
he should respect tradition
have a hectic day
where do you live
it'll do you no good
what's for dinner tonight
help my friend mr richard
like an old fire horse
the big charleston contest
i won't shut up
but horses tire bit by bit
now look what you've done
you'd think i was on the witness stand
the city sealer's office
the noise came from the basement
strange images passed through my mind
you skinned him alive
this is for the boy
we must stay hidden
you call this a happy family
don't you know me
the meeting was over
i'm not interested in your book
nothing of the kind
i'll tell you what i'll do
what do you know about miranda
they said nothing else
your luck's not with you now
aren't you going to tell me
aren't you going to tell me
what can i do for you
the thing's not working
will you do that for me
it was a juggernaut
i've got to go
can i come in
he took out one of the stones
she knows it too
the old man left the book
we need somebody like you
cover up that transmitter
these are not camels
wait for the end of the war
i've always wanted to do this
there was a general movement backwards
i bet you forgot the wine
please don't make me
you can keep her on
let him have everything he wants
better let me talk to him
these pills do less good than others
what a time to be alive
did you get him
they wanted to save the oasis
may i go in and see him
there was no trace of him
graham had trained rigourously
then i don't get paid
then i don't get paid
it was a bundle of money
your account's still here
in a couple of minutes
it's for annabelle
you're through deciding anything
a practice of infidels he said to himself
this convention is a natural
you're hurting my sore foot
they become a part of everything
they become a part of everything
i may have overslept
who told you to do that
but they were not there
but they were not there
what do you think of that
just tell them marge sent you
i want to know what it is
she sends for you
we now have a new base for shipping
have a good time
i myself heard nothing of that
he has other things to do first
he has other things to do first
get a load of this
aiding an escaped criminal
about three hundred thousand
i should have been there
maybe she didn't even remember him
the boy was becoming nervous
this is a common misconception sheldon said
was the doctor here
i should say not
i should say not
play lastfm
i guess i've seen everything now
i think jamie did it
think i'd better be going
i almost dropped him
i'll show you what i'm doing
they had a lot to divulge
and this is true
i second mr potter's motion
well then we've got a problem
you fight it cut
out with larry's deputies
let's not tempt him with the quarter pounder
i am going to the usa tomorrow
do you know him
i don't blame you
what are they doing
look around some time
i don't know you from adam
i guess they just can't help it
now listen to me
now listen to me
they all say they wrote the letter
the reader just needs to know what it does
there is no fighting against fate
why didn't you say something
the boy put the stones in his pouch
what the devil do you want
these trousers don't fit very well
edgar is a geek
but enough of this
all of them are good
as hard as nails
can i get you a drink
now attend to me
what are you here for this morning
you have dilated pupils
get out of the way
ouch that was uncalled for
the trunk of a statue
live and let live
how beautiful she was
he was born in vienna
away in a manger
she made no reply
how can i help you madam
it was a revelation to me
the bus was late today
what are you thinking of
the red paper brightened the dim stage
nothing has been the matter
i only want to rouse him
terracotta sighing
don't be so silly
it was half past eight
how do you do esther
i am a serious man
i have heard so
put your trust in god
did you know that
but i'm not going to do it
he expertly gutted the rabbit
please do not feed the ducks
show a clean pair of heels
i don't know what to do
the boy was there when the sun rose
robbing peter to pay paul
it ought not to deceive a child
we need more soap
i blew my whistle
i love the fjords of norway
beauty is in the eye of the beholder
i had youth and hope
not on your life
make hay while the sun
good luck
henry is sitting in the bathtub
stop bashing ivy all the time
of course for the best
and which family would that be
not a moment was to be lost
a cat has nine lives
okay that's not it
patience is a virtue
every one is king in his own house
business before pleasure
that is not his mailbox
the cork popped out
care's no cure
do you see that
what's to be done
come in come in
it was too late
celia made no movement
what were we to do
i thought i saw flames
im coming to that
there's a surprise within the gift
in sicilian style
there is no help for it
life begins at forty
what has he done
i am going to asia tomorrow
where is my dress
why bless my soul
then she looked up
then continue twiddling
might i use your phone
it weighs five kilograms
let the buyer beware
we only have a handful left
the door was open
what are you laughing at
better late than never
what did you think of that trip
what's this one
only we must begin quick
are you in pain
allison found her phone
there was a short silence
so where's the necklace
of course it is conjecture
on pain of death
arms coat of arms
but what are we to do
the letter ain't worth nothing
they jumped out of the window
what do you know about this
three people play soccer in the sand
you liked the platinum one with the diamonds
who is this man
i want to talk to you
i bet you forgot the wine
how about that one there
but she'll be there
i was just going to
i guess you forgot something
they reminded him of the old man
what do you think of that
i did not know
do you know ahmed
i should say not
there's the door right there
what's going on here
don't tell me what to do
this is a ludicrous situation
it means my job
and we had a bite
look at the bottle you took the powder from
my chinchilla eats bread
who wants to see liver pills
not if i know it
shall i pray for him
is sam with you
did you make a speech
i like cyndi wayne
the president just decorated him
we were in the same outfit
he quickly pulled his hands away
i'm doing everything humanly possible
that's what it means
but what is it
how do you know it
is your husband with you
dog running in a field
the englishman said nothing
take hold of the cover
look where you're going
two men working under a sign
keep your shirt on
hope you enjoy it
casper predicted the outcome
i'm a sucker for this country
life begins at forty
words can hurt very much
a small creek cut across the field
say something else
it doesn't have to rhyme
haven't you got a bullet i can bite
why can't you get along with her
i don't need any help
what's up homies
now attend to me
ouch that was uncalled for
is there anything i can do for you
why didn't you phone me up
did you know that
as like as two peas
have you the key
a friend of yours
but what is the use of talking
well i think so
oh i beg your pardon
where did it come from then
it gives a very nice deep sound
kiss and make up
do you know him
it is an ephemeral video
did you rewind the cassette
but enough of this
how do i know
can you tell me where it hurts
a friend of yours
do you see that
what will they think
what does it matter
that'll close my account
experience is the best teacher
i didn't have it
joel is a good guy
i never thought of that
i'll tell you something more
you mean you and me
a whole week in bermuda
have a hectic day
and i'll sign a paper
turn on the lights
did you make a speech
how do you know she didn't
all the wealth comes from the pockets
over here in the bushes
tomorrow morning at ten o'clock
same for coal
a genuine loving cup
it's the only answer
they showed me at the hospital
they showed me at the hospital
there was a murmur from the crowd
will you do that for me
a touch of colic
and don't wear your high hat
he walked slowly through the market
where are we going
i'd like to take a bath
how about that one there
what's the matter with everybody
how could it be awkward
she has to do something about it
much ado about nothing
people on a ski lift
get the governor on the phone
what is the matter
thank you very much
so you got married
you want the moon
you're doing a great job so far
of course there is
thank god you're there
you can hear out of it
are you enjoying london
they're closing in on you
what on earth does this mean
did you speak to mr norton
yeah i like that
dont you like it
lemme have the desk
get this car out of here
i don't know you from adam
you'll ask me to what
you'll ask me to what
you don't know who did it
what do you want to know
then what did you do
why should it be awkward
grandma is fearless
i'm not easier to live with than he was
what do you know about that
mind the gap
my advice is duck and cross with your right
he should respect tradition
turn on the lights
anything i can do back here
we were in the same outfit
he made her another bow
is it warm here now
the boy listened quietly
it's a good face
how do you know it
i don't blame them
but how can you be sure
the new law was retroactive
maybe tomorrow will be better than yesterday
if you know the time why do you ask me
i'm not very good at this
you know you did
i shouldn't think so
but i sort of like him
no that's not what i mean
she could still be alive
how would you like a punch in the nose
and you married her
white dog playing in the snow
they're on their way
a lot of money
they won't let me go
you been in a fight
i didn't mean to shoot him
nice to meet you
today's world is full of commercials
these trousers don't fit very well
out of debt out of danger
just how big is that closet
i murmured musingly
as green as grass
what did you say your name was
why did you do it
i have already forgiven her
tenderly tenor
come on just stop thinking about it
they were ladies of the night
tell him to sod off
do you think he looks silly
my bad
what does this mean
what good would that do
why should you not
lend you a handkerchief
is it all right
what should she tell him
that's why i'm quitting
which view would you like
i like cyndi wayne
but what's all this
amy's a genius at research
the terror was palpable
if you want it you must take it
betty was surprised
i'm just a fool
how about some wine
whom are you calling now
you haven't got your wings yet
do you mind if i wait out here
the whole army of them
has he been here
go out and find her
is there a crowd in the street
i think you're crazy
more haste less speed
he's home cooking dinner
and you married her
what's its value today
you got plenty of money
you got plenty of money
i'm not supposed to tell
better late than never
you don't have to apologize
is there school today
well i don't know
what's she saying now
no sense in going up there
nobody knows where she got it
there's a moon out tonight
i didn't have it
she was the one in charge of everything
you'll be the only one who'll swipe any of it
take me out of here
two boys are running outside
don't press the red button
it is i the boy answered
what are the facts
they all gathered in manchester
they were all furious when the escapade failed
where do you come from
a whole week in bermuda
but everything had changed
ouch that was uncalled for
i shall never forget it
do you read me
it'll be for life
it'll be for life
how far is it
was that question rhetorical
storm and stress
rate the stone key a 5
it doesn't matter he said to his sheep
what'd you wish when you threw that rock
i'll keep you in mind
i think it's marvelous
he's already killed three men
and so do i
are you going to talk or aren't you
well i should think it was sudden
i want to live again
who gets your vote
who gets your vote
that's what she did to me
they said nothing else
maybe that's why they always stay close to me
maybe that's why they always stay close to me
and i hope mark beats higgins
how dare you say a thing like that
how dare you say a thing like that
and tell louie to stick around
where are you from the boy asked
the shepherd said nothing
it has gone now
help me find them
it's not so bad
why are you blaming me
i have already found my treasure
i just happened to be passing by
i'm just a fool
i want to talk to you
back into the excavation
why do people have to tell lies
can you think of anything better
because now he knew where his treasure was
turn up the volume
may i go in and see him
hurry up and we'll go out
i sold crystal and crossed the desert
i want to look at my flower
thank you said the boy
the boy was surprised at his thoughts
the boss sent me over with it
a barefoot jogger in a park
get the governor on the phone
the game is afoot
her records were incomplete
i'd like to live in it
this is what i wished for
this is what i wished for
work for somebody else
but i sort of like him
thank you very much
everything i do is friendly
have you got a mirror
but they were not there
hunches his mother used to call them
i want to know what it is
i didn't tell anybody
get me a rewrite woman
i can't let her out
that's big of you
you didn't have to do any cleaning he said
two horsemen waiting ahead of them
aiding an escaped criminal
i don't think so
may i sit down
it's even higher than this
i cannot do that
there's the door right there
what are we to do
joanne ought to be back by now
they both spoke the same language
the boy brought his horse closer
he's probably trying the gate
where she used to live
every dog has its day
she shook her head
the wind has many names
based on the omens of the present
we want to see you
she got the congressional medal of honor
oh dear oh dear
don't try to move
two rabbits in a cage
i haven't heard the baby complain yet
and he gets it right away
you can't believe it's not butter
sure i will be right back
who says i can't
i've got a flash for you
i thought he's immune to the flu
he put it in his back pocket
i'm afraid it'll be steve tina
what's she saying now
i haven't won my wings yet
wait just a minute now
what makes you think that
have you been here ever since
please shut the door
how does that strike you
the eyes are blue
not if i know it
as green as grass
it would be useless
open the window
he did not rush in
what's amiss old boy
he drew out his hand again
green moss grows on the northern side
it appears to be true
hey stop staring at my decollete
can you tell me
about one in twenty
tonight she must not fail
which door said the frog
look round you
but it was so
it felt like a jolt
what did i tell you
he rose from his bed
elena will be late
the meek shall inherit the earth
advertise with us
money makes the man
what did it matter
did you know that
do you know me
do you hear me
how do you know it
i had an english breakfast
it's pretty straightforward isn't it
show a clean pair of heels
i don't know yet
and what's more you know it
she is seven months pregnant
what is my function
shant said the cook
the balance is zero
she would not let him go
better safe than sorry
what is today
its on the sixth aisle
you can't get blood out of a stone
nor can i imagine
have you seen hollie
that is not her house
it had crossed my mind
how can we put this right
i cannot believe it
now what is it
but i knew better
youll come to it in time
it is not to be thought of
why bless my soul
ruth is upset
and this is true
everything has an end
how can i tell
just joshing
hold the line a minute
do you want me
nobody can serve two masters
good evening
he did not look up
but what does it mean
i'm feeling too good
some place to live
can i get a woot woot
tell them mrs craig is here
it'll do you no good
is there anything wrong
what do you mean by that
now look what you've done
now that's too much
her old man was doc mitchell
i thought you were asleep
only when he consents
if something isn't done
you've got the money
how about that one there
i'm not very good at this
and who accused him
a friend of yours
does she have the money
you want the moon
i'm leaving town tonight
did you get a doctor
he's talking like a child
now listen to me
and so do you
a fabulous tale
i didn't have it
the old man returned the book to the boy
i need one more
but he decided to take a chance
is it a deal or isn't it
shall i pray for him
come on in here now
with all of it
who are these people
we'll save them for seed
help my son megan tonight
what a strange kind of person
if that guy lays an egg
you skinned him alive
what's done is done
life is complicated
then he turned to the boy
they say it's a fake
that's all you are
well what of that
mars is almost uninhabitable
we need to talk
that's a really great idea
you don't have to make all that fuss about it
you're demanding your rights
my mother just called you
let us sit down
you want the moon
that's all i want to know
no that's not what i mean
he's in my room
but it was too late
i myself heard nothing of that
casper predicted the outcome
there is nothing the matter with me
where she used to live
every dog has its day
it isn't the money
it receded into the hole
this is a ludicrous situation
later a bridge was built
but that was not all
the papers were graded
what are the facts
few words and many deeds
do you know those people
it is nearly dinner time
sorry we didn't even know you were here
have you got what it takes
and which family would that be
very kind indeed
business before pleasure
can i borrow your bike
describe it to me
dont you like it
hoist the load to your left shoulder
you are her dream man
what do you mean to do
who is your father
what must i do
whose men are you
it was a great success
the vamp of the shoe had a gold buckle
what are you doing there
take me back there
turn on the lights
i'd like to think
i got it all ready
anything i can do back here
we need to run
kate frank's a baker
never mind those guys
march was windy and dark
and that's another thing
what are they gonna think about you
you've got to do something
i'll give you a break
who's got the room next to hers
there was no trace of him
what can i do now
form follows function
is this the place
so far so good
i get thirty dollars a week
the decision was already made
that was the law of hospitality
blood and iron letter
let's see the money
how much do you want
i don't want to kill anybody
and i think it's terrific
don't say those things
can i get a woot woot
i think i found something
i can't do that
isn't it a little crowded
on the 3 o'clock train
what is she to do
come out of there
must have been a kid
i'll tell you something more
you can't unscramble a scrambled egg
don't press the red button
we know what you're up to
will you come with me
the proportions were all wrong
too bad he has to be fed on a bottle
everything's going to be all right
what have you done
go on out and get rid of it
there was very little talking
tell them mrs craig is here
what's the matter with you
i'm going to check up on that right away
one that will write
they rode for the entire day
the packaging was broken
context is needed
attack is the best means of defence
i'm getting trevor ready
a sight for sore eyes
who are these people
people that never had to worry
i am only available on wednesday
loop the braid to the left and then over
i got it all ready
but they're somebody's children
how do you know she didn't
about one in twenty
don't be an idiot
i don't want to take any chances
i'll be right there
is there anything wrong
the boy awoke as the sun rose
catherine walked alongside the canal
a woman practicing for tennis
an elderly man sitting on a bench
i'm going to them
i'm going to them
april cuddled her lamb
and don't bump into anything
it was the devil
eta 1130
i've done nothing of the sort
i've done nothing of the sort
what's so illogical about that
but you are in the desert
let's pretend everything is prepped
what do you know about miranda
pull the hook to toggle the jukebox
he decided to spend the night there
if you want it you must take it
that's what i'd like to know
you are welcome i suppose
how dare you say a thing like that
don't you like her
what do you want
who's this gal she's gonna marry
i don't believe it
as like as two peas
i think maybe you'd better
never mind those guys
is that any good
that is all i have to say
i heard a faint movement under my feet
it reminded him of the wool from his sheep
the man was speaking the language of alchemy
that might be all right
the boy climbed the dune slowly
i want to talk to you
about time one of you lunkheads said it
somebody would have seen it
got to be a sergeant
nobody's trying to steal from you
i was sent down here to clean house
do you like cooking
when did you arrive in town
the handle snagged my coat
so you can kill me too
i'd like to take a bath
this man claims he was kidnapped
indian women sort out clothing
fast food is convenient but often unhealthy
and don't forget these
look where you're going
i want to look at my flower
you should see his fan mail
that's the reason why i came in fourth
and he wasn't faring much better
how could it be awkward
you all know me
the boys'll be coming back to phone
he couldn't have been wrong
just leave your card with the boy
you have been stopping me
who do you want
take good care of him
a cute couple at a club
her records were incomplete
but you don't know about love
that is quite true
a fine bunch of reporters
a fine bunch of reporters
they become a part of everything
that's why i'm an angel second class
the tractor was bearing down hard
i'll be right back
but the boy sat down and waited
i said i was trying to catch one
mr lee can't be bothered now
but you want to know something
the plural of mouse is mice
the floorboards looked loose
the little tales they tell are false
what are you doing in here
the boy spent a sleepless night
they have searched it thoroughly
well it's a long list
has aunt stephanie come in yet
a soccer player kicks a ball
my father fell in love with him
we don't use money in heaven
how would you like a punch in the nose
what can we do
keep your shirt on
i myself heard nothing of that
i myself heard nothing of that
how much will it cost
how much will it cost
i don't want a better one later
little spot's gotta be taken care of
don't argue with me here
janet roger died three months ago
there is no help for it
i find this ferry boring
it's even higher than this
the shower's in there
a fur muff is stylish once more
adam is a crook
the idea frightened him
stick to your clubs
say something else
there was no respite to be had

he walked slowly through the market
people on the streets attending rally

who is your father
grasp all lose all
to take a drop too much

but he still couldn't flee
how would you like a punch in the nose
show me where there is life out in the desert
he told me i should try to do so
stove's hotter than i thought
he hunched his back and plodded through the heavy rain
the shaking disturbed the rat nest
i believe what she said
it's still sopping wet

he was immensely excited at the news
it takes two to have an argument
you know what i mean
the window opened outward

angela is pregnant she told me
this is no place for you
that's what i'm not supposed to say
isn't it just beautiful
i'm not working for any other paper
if something isn't done
the whole police force standing on it's ear
about time one of you lunkheads said it

everything's going to be all right
there was very little talking
because he's wearing moccasins
don't say anything fatima interrupted
but everything had changed
sunday will not work for me
but the boy was certain that he had been looking at them
so it's better to listen to what it has to say
this puts me in a peculiar hole
cashier's got your check
a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush

it was there that the wise man lived
poetry and truth

i've wrenched my ankle
you've got lipstick all over your mouth
when did you deliver this first
i've done nothing of the sort
just like an organ
i can't please everybody
a woman is inspecting some sort of device
angry words fan the fire like wind
when will it be warmer in benin

i've watched you grow up from a little boy
well he thought about that the old man said
he won't leave the circle
there are a lot of seats over there
i won't let you
she's accused of stealing a watch
all things are one the boy thought
i've got to talk to you straight from the shoulder

he fondled his bright orange beard
can you give me one good reason why i should
his grandfather was a snake
it required people to settle down

back into the excavation
the old man said nothing
robin had some sort of date with tracy
raccoons are mammals as well

why do people have to tell lies
what a time to be alive
fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent
the ghost laughed in the weirdest way
for dinner they had cesar salad
all they think about is food and water
all they think about is food and water
homeless man holding a sign
save your sister a piece or she will be mad
what are you doing tonight
jazz and swing fans like fast music
moist soil is good for the flora
but now the sounds inside had stopped
there goes another scrub lady
he had surprised himself with the thought
innocent as a new born babe
what would you do with a gun in your back
three youngsters shovel a huge pile of snow
this can arouse national interest
i recommend the omni pedal quad
i didn't know whose it was

she was waiting for her response
one picture is worth a thousand words
he has other things to do first
it's a terrible reflection on our city
how can you tell
the martinis cross themselves
i don't want a better one later
i'm afraid i already know a great many people
