there was another silence
it's free to smile
what did he want
i got a call from ben

twenty thousand dollars a year
it sounded like a gypsy prayer
take me out of here
and you can meet us at the station

i'm beginning to realize that
like everybody learns he said
enemy spotted

but i don't have it
they won't let me go
what do you think of him
what do you mean to do

hey don't go there
i'm filled with despair

raccoons are mammals as well
this is a trick to get your sympathy
the boy shook his head
from then on he would make his own decisions
you can't say that about my father
fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me
i'll keep you in mind
you go on and practice
the vertex was out of alignment
it's a good face
three people in a green house

what's to be done
the mother sat in the courtroom
may i sit down
are you strong enough
and what are you doing here
might i use your phone
what is it you want
have you been to japan
of course i'm right
could you trust in him
what makes you think that
how are you getting on
is that how your niece began
yours sincerely satan
the same noise
but you want to know something
it didn't change anything
add new metal tracks in my tune
and so will you
look where you're going
i don't blame you
he put it in his back pocket
he wasn't an alchemist
but enough of this
what does he look like
how can that be
display a list of escape characters
it takes two to tango

karl is over there
might start to rain again
rome wasn't built in a day
i'll take that bet
a clean neck means a neat collar
what's she doing over here
it's done in america all the time
i should have repeated it for him
i don't believe it
i'm not gonna talk about them
the monk was irritated
i tell you that it's no good
i'm going to scream
i'm filled with despair
the display was underwhelming
i'm smoking too much
is this the place
you want the moon
she was waiting for her response
you can hear out of it
i'd like to have my robe
i don't miss a single feature
what are you doing
i rang the bell
your government is counting on you
you just pat him
collateral of any kind

down on his luck
what do you mean to do

so immerse yourself in it
the handle snagged my coat

the wind began to pick up
they could barely see the boy
they're just a pile of stones
what does he look like
good morning how are you
she did not know
there's no accounting for tastes
but you are in the desert
first you got to sign a receipt
good evening
i didn't frisk him
everybody knows you're a sweetheart
you're shaking the house down
the money's not here
what did you say
i should have been there
the boy was becoming nervous
now what is it
help the weak to preserve their strength
but i knew better
it takes two to have an argument
you fight it cut
what are you laughing at
that man is terrific
your government is counting on you
you got your sea legs yet
what can have happened
the rocking motion was nauseating
and who hired you for this
what are the facts

i cannot believe it
would you like a cappuccino
she shook her head
your good health
i rang the bell
who is the blonde girl with the red skirt
what makes you think i'd answer you
i ain't gonna squeal
the vertex was out of alignment
it was a mega monster made of metal
until my wing went bad
i'll give it a drink
it didn't change anything
why can't i skip this damn intro
the ceiling collapsed inwards
besides that there was a heap of bicycles
isn't a word of truth in it
all i want to do is be let alone
i'll be right back
what's the idea of locking this
one cant be too careful
you're just like father used to be
was the doctor here
bush leagues mostly
how many people do you think will be there
i was just asking
what's she saying now
just give me more time
why didn't you object when you could
do you like fruit
what shall we do
then she pushed her out
but how can you be sure
peace came years after the war
a friend of yours
the pencils have all been used
why are we doing this again
mission accomplished
a dog running in the surf
that's not my money
the telephone didn't work without electricity
see if we can move it
thank god for that
i'm supposed to know my way around
the old man returned the book to the boy
the puncture didn't slow him down at all
she doesn't know it yet
they stood there looking at the moon
don't worry about that
your heart is alive
i don't know she said
how beautiful she was
storm and stress
i want to see the chieftains
do you see this
i'm going to them
there's not a reason on earth why you should
i'm addicted to recycling
hey foxy
her old man was doc mitchell
i thought you were asleep
life is complicated
children playing on a playground
never mind those guys
i have not decided yet
stop beating around the bush
i'm not gonna talk about them
help me find them
the taylor jean movement isn't dead yet
how much is it worth
she's good enough for me
they rode alongside each other gracefully
is that job still open
then where is your gun
the boy began to dig into the dune
we can't leave greg here
and he told what he had seen
why didn't i call you back
everybody knows you're a sweetheart
please don't make me
i'm going to scream
what game do you want to play
i am certain it was on friday
he had surprised himself with the thought
albert didn't have a brother
he'll drive you batty
somebody's going to get hurt
that's true the boy thought
i've been trying to get her to come to
you sure nothing's missing
what we need is fireworks
take a couple of seconds
how are you doing today
you tell me and i will do it
is this the right one to choose
what did he ever do for his country
the caterpillar responded with a nod
the driver got knocked cold
so you got married
times are different now
i'm so hungry i could faint
she has all your features
because they're still here
the corruption ran deep
she didn't have one
she called his name many times
or a man into the wind
there was no respite to be had
now who'da done a mean thing like that
the decision was already made
you've got everything all set
i couldnt stop staring at it
i'm not supposed to tell
i only interpret dreams
that man is terrific
i'm going home and see my wife and family
what's she saying now
what are you doing there

fore warned is fore armed
where are the others

how do you know that it is correct
he might hit their mother again
where did that come from
who is your father
money makes the man
what must i do

i could see it too
hey don't go there
hey don't go there
she rose to her feet
how bad can a boss be
i'm a detective not an economist

what did he want
fortunately nobody was hurt in this disaster
i am dumb
which way do you go
this time we know it is correct
what have you there

cattle plague
let us formulate what we know
adversity tries friends
i think maybe you'd better
and if it is
i gave you fifty just the other day

but she hadn't charged him anything
