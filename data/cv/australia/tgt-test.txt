the very idea of it was preposterous
one surfer riding a wave in the blue waters
i'm in bed and starting to cough unfortunately
i am in town on leave just now said richard
you know what that means
not a bit of it
mr george shook his head in the most emphatic manner
the store walls were lined with colored frocks
a girl running with a basketball while another tries to steal the ball from her
his face quite altered as he looked at me
the phone rang while she was awake
the team equalized just before half time
a person jumping off a rock formation in the desert
two little boys playing soccer on a field
more discussion is needed on how it will be financed
lock the door  quietly  from the inside
bonnie loves clyde and vice versa
burning fridges televisions and washing machines are not as unusual as one might think
tremulous vibration of a note
the trio has said their name is a tribute to the andrews sisters
