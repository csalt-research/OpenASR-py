so that was it
we broke it in half
then what did you do

i'm going to them
you want the moon
of course it is
did you see it
never mind what desk
i wish you'd forget about us
do you know what you're going to do
i didn't see any point
she knows everything
i'd like to live in it
you're on the board here
it would kill you
are you going to live with your mother
you can get them for me
i can see that right now
the one in there
what were you doing in boston
i came over with johnny
aren't you going to tell me
there was no trace of him
i like ice cream
how are you doing
because they're still here
how should i know
you think you did
i'm sure of it
what did he want
don't you think so
what's going on in there
was it a good idea
i knew you would come
i'll take mine now
then came a war
and will we do things
i don't want any plastics
you like every boy
he's in my room
the boy was startled
that's what i'm going to do
there was no doubt about it
what do you want here
so you want to add a third
what have i missed
what's going on here
where are the others
i know i know
i'm sure of it
who are these people
he's nuts about you
and what did she say
what is it all about
i never had any such idea
as they browsed the store together
he didn't mind the extra work
he's always making a speech
my phone is in my back pocket
we went to the beach to sunbathe
you can get them for me
i am so glad
put your trust in god
get out of this
what is today
mind the gap
yes that's what love is
which one are you
you haven't told me
did you get him
i'm through listening to you
is it for humans
i want my wife
but how can you be sure
what did he say
i'll get it for you
thanks for the clarification
if something isn't done
there was hardly anyone there
who is it from
mine's in the door
is it all right
full circle
can i come in
what is his name
what game do you want to play
say hello to new york for me
tell them mrs craig is here
they jumped out of the window
to keep on pitching
he's been crying for five minutes
we've run out of petrol and diesel
the vertex was out of alignment
this is for the boy
they exploited their guests
i'm sending it over with beth
but what is it
that tina thought it was funny
i say we don't go out any more
what did he look like
i'll see you after
a lot of money
are you going to live with your mother
what's that got to do with it
something terrible's happened to me
i don't know you from adam
i saw him get it
get me walter burns
what's up homies
what does that get us
she knows everything
what's going on here
i didn't see anything
who says i can't
that's why i'm quitting
i didn't do anything
i need a break
so now i'm a camel driver
what did i tell you
we need to talk
do you know what i mean
i'm going to tell your mother on you
who is this man
and he told what he had seen
i'll go right after it
he really doesn't look so bad
but i like it that way
seems like yesterday to me
i just wanted to be sure
good riddance
keep your shirt on
how can you tell
adam is a crook
i don't blame you
we've got to get bail
did you get the mayor
dont you like it
now what is it
take me back there
that's why i'm quitting
what could be more american
i'm a sucker for this country
then what did you do
what on earth does this mean
i'll take mine now
wouldn't do any good
is this the place
how do we know it's really over
you know you did
many drops make a shower
it's not a lie
the children were almost tyrannical
what's the matter with my brain
it was a very warm october
if i know where she is
i'm going to them
i'm going to miss annie
your luck's not with you now
i wished i had a light to smoke by
it brought his heart into his mouth
only when he consents
the check will be certified
what was he like
if you close your doors before six pm
there was no other baggage
that was his work
the report was largely scathing
and if it is
she says it's nothing to worry about
you can hear out of it
your crew will do the mop up job
the idea frightened him
the three fell silent
how would you like to work for me
a conservative
where did the clouds come from
how far is it
why don't you speak
what do you want
what did he grow
very well very well
as sure as i am alive
then whose is it
about how wealthy would you say
she knows it too
did you finish the interview
i can't quite hear you
well interpret the dream he said
i thought i'd buy them some groceries
i'm leaving today said the boy
you're a newspaper man
give her the works
but you are in the desert
get me a pitcher's glove
wear the blue one
caramels are the best
i didn't see any point
what would you do with a gun in your back
what would i have to say
that's a good idea
i didn't tell anybody
the arrow was pointing to the exit
what do you say
the shaking disturbed the rat nest
the shower's in there
she'll be all right
don't try to move
take charge of him
you won't miss anything
how did it happen
easy come easy go
who is your father
will you hear it
what are we going to do
thank you'
this plank was made for walking on
there was no answer
some place to live
i suppose i could
the hell you say
what do you want
do you mind if i wait out here
the door was locked
but he'd have to
not with my money
she comes by it naturally
don't be a fool
how do you feel
don't you like her
isnt this a parameter of the method
did you get him
he's a fanatic
i've heard her speak of you
with all of it
you can do this
you know where they are
you can keep her on
but they were not there
you'll have to wake him up
i have heard so
what did you do it for
we wiped the board
wear the blue one
and he gave the boy his blessing
the smoker cleared his lungs of phlegm
might start to rain again
then stop acting like one
the old woman had said the same thing
many telescopes were pointed at it
there were mountains in the distance
i don't want anything else in life
get me a pitcher's glove
then the thing came upon him in a flash
i was impatient to see it opened
i'll hang it up
that was his work
but they were not there
he was just and good
of course there is
seize the day
to keep their tongues
he says it's the chance of a lifetime
i can't find it anywhere
these families have children
a child hugs a birdhouse
she just stepped out
capital town
what can you do
what can you do
i'll catch a bus
she doesn't know it yet
it was about you
as quick as that
if something isn't done
that's what killed him
aren't we godlike
that's why i'm quitting
bye for now
are you a real cowboy
i've stuck it back together
it sure looks good from here
doug's a good friend of mine
but a lovely chap
what does he say
i almost dropped him
of course it is
you won't miss anything
where did he go
what was she like
we need to hurry
how much does this cost
how can i ever face him
i don't know about war
he really was a king
don't do it for me
the letter ain't worth nothing
there was very little talking
it'll do you no good
you can do this
what's for dinner tonight
i got it back
strange images passed through my mind
this is for the boy
good morning
sounds legitimate
they were kissing in the backyard
some storms are worth the wreckage
that's all you are
what did they say
i'm not gonna talk about them
which one are you
look at those shoulders
now go eat your dinner
what's he doing here
but now the sounds inside had stopped
you all know me
you're hurting my sore foot
i used to pitch
what is the matter
who is your favourite author
you haven't seen anything yet
thank god you're there
and one or two persons were returning
because they're still here
she didn't have one
they're forming clubs
the idea frightened him
are you going to listen
i've already told you
i want you to be my wife
i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
he was immensely excited at the news
did you give her the money
can you hear me
i think i got a date
you can't believe it's not butter
there's been an accident
is that okay
for crying out loud
i can't quite hear you
give me my book the boy said
what do you think of him
what shall we do
what do you want
call joe
what else am i to do
are you in pain
he decided it wasn't enough
what time was it
get down quick
this looks amazing
he's in my room
we're a different world
oh you are eh
why can't she get along with me
it was linda keller
i found it out a little late
he was my brother
the richest man in town
get some water quickly
why did you tell me
fifty cents on the dollar
i don't know you from adam
picture's in the paper
what are you doing up here then
what does she say
how do you mean
what would you do
i'm proud of you
the car engine has seized
she wasn't her type
you've got about two minutes
give me my robe
that's what it means
i phoned but nobody answered
what does it matter
are you strong enough
i rang the bell
there is a way
did you see him
i want to live again
he was my brother
i'll be right back
when i returned to the common the sun was setting
don't do it for me
how do you mean
it drew a droplet of blood
so how will we name all these hurricanes
what have you got to report
i guessed as much
did you want to see me
what was she like
i'm not afraid of failing
i know how they feel
the boy awoke before dawn
why should it be awkward
two young people are kissing
how do i know
what is it tom
she made no reply
nothing to it
a magistrate
now i must go
what did you eat for dinner
how was the food there
the yellow fish swam across the lake
did you do that
what was her name
no olivia is a brunette
people are cleaning up a street
thanks for dropping around
so that was it
i'll be next door
love sees no faults
the boy shook his head
i've got to go to him
i'll tell you why they did it
doug's a good friend of mine
she and heather were talking
of course you never did
the speech will continue
something smells around here
amen
maybe that's why they came
how do you stop this thing
what are they like
it'll be for life
i think it's plenty terrific
you know how dreams are
that's why i keep losing
there's the city hall tower i'm supposed to visit
she never told her that
we'll carry the desk over
they rode for the entire day
it didn't even occur to the boy to flee
but he's on the right track
i want to see the chieftains
i got it back
you may kiss my hand
that's why i'm here
it seemed so safe and tranquil
the ceiling collapsed inwards
he just got a new kite for his birthday
i can see april coming
they were kissing in the backyard
it was early morning when she woke up
some storms are worth the wreckage
it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
i heard a faint movement under my feet
i heard a faint movement under my feet
we'll pay all your expenses
is it all right
is it all right
is it all right
a man is playing a guitar
it was a bundle of money
aren't we godlike
aren't we godlike
its lower end was still embedded
what would i have to say
see you in the funny papers
a fine bunch of reporters
three cheers for aden christopher
there were thirty girls on the soccer field
you can only spit out so many seeds
sorry to keep you waiting
what boat you sailing on
a man is playing the saxophone
the shower's in there
i saw neil yesterday afternoon
it was just right
it was papa that sends you flowers every day
it dribbled down the fridge
my leg's going to sleep
you got your sea legs yet
the top had certainly ceased to rotate
we played outside
why do you do it
is it all right
what is today
what could it be
oh i know it
have you seen it
sure i will be right back
what can i do
where'd you wire him
i won't ever tell a soul
lemme have the desk
this makes me feel funny
on the 3 o'clock train
it is all right
we'll carry the desk over
don't worry about that
you've never been born
better let me talk to him
all set for the big night
it's the oasis said the camel driver
i'll be right back
and i will be the policeman
it was just right
christ
oh i know it
do i know it
what did he say
what's in it for me
will no one go
sounds legitimate
he's on the way
look at it today
you can't do that to me
how do you like her
you have no identity
i wish you'd let me help you
he asked for him
turn on the lights
who are these people
i have no more to say
don't you know me
for donkeys' ages
this isn't a kidnapping
a short sonata
he'll drive you batty
that's a good idea
take her to the infirmary
but i knew better
they won't let me go
worse and worse
i won't say anything
what does she say
hardwick
may i sit down
why are you not at work
what is he like
storm and stress
are you in the book
are you going to call me
you fight it cut
that doesn't say much for mine
can i get a woot woot
i never knew he had a diary
a black dog runs through the water
i'm gonna build air fields
they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
it'd be too late
not unless we're blind
he began to dig at the base of the sycamore
better let me talk to him
seems like yesterday to me
and he wasn't faring much better
he'll drive you batty
you're the only one who could have it
she refilled her vessel and left
i can't let her out
i myself heard nothing of that
i done my best
it's on the level
the sword remained where it was
i don't want mrs douglas
the wind has many names
the book was written in spanish
this is no time to give up
carol hid inside the shipping container
a man is looking at a shrub
the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
and a glass of milk
my chinchilla eats bread
not very quick
where are the others
you are quite right
i don't know she said
here is an idea
as like as two peas
i guessed as much
what else could it be
ten episodes aired
is it raining right now
and this is true
you look like one
i didn't have it
let me out of here
what have you done kevin
i've got to go to him
get out of here
might start to rain again
shoot through the desk
have you got it
think about that
i'm leaving town tonight
two guys working off the rail
some place to live
what is your name
that's what i'd like to know
how dare you say a thing like that
you got fifty cents
you can't stay here
afraid it might rain
just one thing more
the car engine has seized
you keep out of this
that's what i am
i'm playing for keeps
in st
a friend of yours
what do you think of that
what do you know about that
get the riot gear
it's like a plague
it didn't change anything
i can't do that
shall i pray for him
you mean spies and things like that
and up a dime
raisins are delicious
they exploited their guests
it was our money and we want it back
the boy was getting irritated
didn't you know that
they raise their glasses
wait till you try to turn around
have a good look
i just got rid of one crowd
fast food is convenient but often unhealthy
or do you think it would spoil him
your account's still here
the girl is leaping into the lake
this is keith miller
i've had this shop for thirty years
i'm going to tell her what i think of her
all i say is spit them out
it looked like a rusty gas float
i'm through listening to you
i'm not doing it for you
i myself heard nothing of that
but it was not to be
it is still a phenomenal movement
it's got to be somewhere
that was all right
i haven't heard the baby complain yet
you can't believe it's not butter
exactly answered the alchemist
to each his own
collateral of any kind
what the devil do you want
abraham provided many treats
one must prepare for it
i haven't won my wings yet
the top had certainly ceased to rotate
oh you are eh
can i get you a drink
i am so glad
how did you assist
why is pinball so addictive
if the cap fits wear it
what did i tell you
but what can i do
how did you get in before
do you see that
keep it up
is it raining right now
did you see it
kiss and make up
why would i want to do that
no not for them
i won't let you
i don't believe it
i'd like to take a bath
turn up the volume
right on the second floor there
they're closing in on you
you're a big help
this investment won't pay off
do it for the paper
we must stay hidden
how often do you want to eat
i want to leave this with you
you did a swell job
never heard of such a thing
but i never said anything like that
but you can't do that
the shepherd swore that he would
will you do this
what have you there
what did he do
we're having hamburgers
did you make a speech
nice of you to come down
take your paws off me
how could it be awkward
do you need any help
mine's in the door
i tore him apart
monday morning at five o'clock
my laptop has crashed
your account's still here
i told you baldwin was in trouble
a cat has nine lives
but the boy sat down and waited
aiding an escaped criminal
the englishman didn't answer him directly
just step on it
but she is gone
we played outside
what are the facts
why did you do it
what should she tell him
what is it dear
are you in pain
do you want me
yeah i'll look in to it
mind the gap
you may kiss my hand
i'm getting married tomorrow
but what's all this
i'll give you a break
i think jamie did it
i'll always let you down
see if we can move it
how do you feel
don't let her shoot
as hard as nails
the wind began to blow again
don't talk too loud
i'm going to school
i've got to go to him
i turned upon her
well i should think it was sudden
football is often confused with soccer
he was alarmed by what had happened
the shepherd said nothing
i've stuck it back together
my review of the sun one star
and he told what he had seen
i beg your pardon
a bride and groom leaving after the wedding
the water was crystal clear
three fisherman on a dock
let's go hiking across france
a woman is smiling in a park
i don't believe you
how's the weather in nebraska
most of them were staring quietly at the big table
i am following my destiny
sorry to keep you waiting
maybe he really is a fool
do i know it
what were you when you came here five years ago
the sword remained where it was
they had a lot to divulge
the book was written in spanish
she hoisted up the pirate flag
you weren't here to build them
they all say they wrote the letter
only when he himself reveals it
why didn't you tell me
arms coat of arms
cassie dismantled the bicycle
what does it all mean
the sun was shining
me and angela
the students colored with their crayons
it was too late
pretty please with a cherry on top
they have two grown daughters
beauty is but skin deep
dorothy said nothing
her majesty has left the building
great braggers little doers
what genre is it
kenneth powell
he nodded his head
slow and steady wins the race
don't do it for me
but that's what you're doing
i don't see a thing
a half a heelot
who's the ten for
my job requires a lot of travelling
how do you like it
lemme have the desk
we didn't steal it
i don't know you from adam
your age fits you
take me back there
ten minutes ago i had a job
access denied
listen to the woman
i want to live again
i was impatient to see it opened
he's always making a speech
she and heather were talking
she shook her head
dennis couldn't approach the monolith
and he gets it right away
be right there boss
what am i to do
what are we going to do
what sort of man is he
what's the matter with me
what can have happened
what had happened to them
it's awfully clear now
is it all right
the quicker the better
like master like man
where she used to live
where she used to live
what did he buy a paper for
we're a different world
take me back there
i need one more
i don't know where to go
enough said the boy
she never told her that
there was very little talking
there was very little talking
there was very little talking
we can both hear
it'll do you no good
i wish you wouldn't
mow the lawn
it seemed so safe and tranquil
might start to rain again
a surfer surfs
ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
the twelve dollars includes everything
the meeting was over
sounds legitimate
men compete in an eating contest
he got up early with the idea of finding it
there were mountains in the distance
and i want you to know that i'm coming back
smoking is prohibited
and that's another thing
do you really think so
have you ever tried
robin had some sort of date with tracy
isn't a word of truth in it
it was flowering beautifully
whom are you calling now
he didn't mind the extra work
they wanted to save the oasis
you'd think i committed some sort of crime
i'll work for you he said
press the pedal with your left foot
i may have overslept
who told you to do that
but they were not there
a woman dressed in black
what does that mean
i don't want a better one later
a man in a gray shirt is yawning
where you got him
dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw
i cannot tell you
where did you come from
what do you need
who you holding out on
would you like to dance
where are you bound asked the young arab
two men are talking in a house
she wasn't her type
what are you doing there
i have a list of candidates to replace you
neat plans fail without luck
orange juice then
i just opened the link you sent to me
you will have to wait for it till doomsday
didn't you know that
okay kid ask away
what did he want
is it all right
all roads go to jericho
don't give up
its time to save the internet again
what could it be
to keep their tongues
back to our original plan i think
what do you make of it
i feel so good i could spit
i'm getting married tomorrow
who is this man
we need to hurry
who locked the door
of course it is
fifty cents on the dollar
all our yesterdays
thank god for that
can i get a woot woot
she lives in the park
she must have known alex pretty well
what's my name doing on it
are you going to go to julia's
she'll see us through dinner
the boy was getting irritated
you'd better start right now
you don't call this a convenience
it was repetitious but soothing
monkeys smile when they are scared
you've got a nerve accusing people of things
but what could he do
what shall we do
will you do this
who would have thought that
then he went in
you're far too valuable
i'm sure you haven't any
i didn't do anything
we'll save them for seed
they showed me at the hospital
he's not a failure
then where is your gun
i couldn't work in the city
i need ten dollars
i like ice cream
you're on the board here
there's the door right there
is it for humans
forget it there is no such thing
thank heaven you're here
the music was captivating
there are a lot of seats over there
what do you know about miranda
who's this gal she's gonna marry
it picks up on the mike
many telescopes were pointed at it
something's the matter with daddy
what did you say
i like ice cream
we all hope i am right
i myself heard nothing of that
and about you too
the carpet was exquisite
why are we doing this again
why don't you say something
how did she look
have you the key
what is today
why are you doing this
what are we to do
jerry could not believe it
but they're somebody's children
he's been crying for five minutes
i can see april coming
that's what it means
and i'm the biggest of the lot
she told them to kidnap me
what's he doing here
his name is welch
take her to the infirmary
now how'd you know that
we want to see you
who's that with the hat
twenty thousand dollars a year
a woman in a yellow shirt eating
how can i thank you
the wind began to blow again
stop treating me like a child
please don't be lazy
the brown dog is running
nor was this all
if you're looking for a room there's no vacancy
she's written to me every day since
i just got an e mail from my crush
we showed up and gave 3 minute speeches each
you shouldn't be here the alchemist answered
i wished i had a light to smoke by
two boys wakeboard
even then he hardly understood what this meant
it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
my wacom tablet has a dodgy wire
but use them to buy your flock
what's it all about
my leg's going to sleep
there must be somebody there
they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
two brown dogs runs through the water
the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
an army is coming the boy said
the boy put the stones in his pouch
the building and what
attack is the best means of defence
famous for its cherries
you are wrong jeeves
do you believe him
how did she look
what did you do it for
what are we going to do
where is my dress
the knife was hung inside its bright sheath
what did you think of that trip
where is it then
what have i missed
can you record this for me
where did you find that apple
play moris tepper
but then he stopped
i'll be right there
is there anything wrong
what do you mean it's okay
what are they gonna think about you
of course it's the place
what did you stop it for
she improved her list every day
we had a lot of hurricanes this year
that's all i ask
i've got a weakness
bush leagues mostly
you know what i mean
that's a swell bracelet you're wearing
give her the works
shoot through the desk
so now i'm a camel driver
he expertly gutted the rabbit
i was impatient to see it opened
and continue to pay heed to the omens
that's only the beginning
the sheep had taught him that
i wish they were rabbits
i'll be right back
it was just right
what do they want
i'll show you what i'm doing
used to hunt rabbits there myself
but you've got to leave me alone
where do you want to go
she loves to get up early
the shepherd swore that he would
what is it tom
how far is it
what is the meaning of this
what did you eat for dinner
i did not like her
oh i know it
did you do that
what is it boss
what can have happened
roll the dice please
it's too hot in here
might start to rain again
is there anything wrong
now what do you say
sound and fury
hockey players awaiting a faceoff
he's in my room
i should have been there
he's home cooking dinner
they won't let me go
i saw him get it
the irish man sipped his tea
can you come pick me up at the office
can i get a woot woot
it must be some kind of a gag
i think i will
and he gave the boy his blessing
the old lady didn't mince her words
we'll save them for seed
all they wanted was food and water
i need a drink
he just got a new kite for his birthday
my calendar was full that month
but you are in the desert
a man climbs up a mountain
what's she talking about
didn't you know that
it seems old and wise
a half a heelot
what will you have to drink
that might be all right
just handling them made him feel better
many telescopes were pointed at it
this peach tart is tasty
two ladies posing for a picture
then suddenly he noticed it with a start

the boy was surprised at his thoughts
in alchemy it's called the soul of the world
the whole army of them
the boy fell to his knees and wept

this will never do
that is the question
take your paws off me
two cents worth of shoelaces
may i go in and see him
it was a bundle of money
but now the sounds inside had stopped
you knew the whole story
somebody's going to get hurt
your office telephoned me to hold him
we better hold onto them both
is it for humans
a boy swinging on a swing
the method does not have to be the best
a dog swims in the water
your age fits you

he shook his head
what are the facts

of course the two were unable to do anything
the man juggles six balls easily
you're losing your eye
band doing a concert for people

i'd like to think
a guy pointing at a giant blackberry
lady reading a story from a book
it's not a battle of good against evil
but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
a genuine loving cup
the boy listened quietly
what did i tell you
we need to run
they formed heaps that are visible a mile and a half away
i wonder what he wants
the fumes from the traffic was unbearable
you were going to go out and conquer the world
besides that there was a heap of bicycles
the letter's our only clue
it was flowering beautifully
is the kiss playing
a male is walking down the street
get me my check book
that's true the boy thought
meanwhile the boy thought about his treasure
a woman is walking past a sign
you can't take that desk out
this wool jumper is itchy
the man looked at the angel in surprise
i do the best i can to help
on his hands and knees
my mind ran on the possibilities of its content

it will sound false
let what must be happen
the photo had a hue
how could i help it
where did it come from then
the fly made its way along the wall
to add insult to injury
but not for long
his internet connection was too slow
what does this mean
he advises fleming to go to lena
but that did not console me
it's paid off too
can you tell me
let's see the money
don't do anything i wouldn't do
don't they believe in angels
need to book a table in ludden
he really doesn't look so bad
what did you say

until my wing went bad
but a lovely chap
i'll call the police
i won a flower
thank heaven you're here
i had to hand over all our cash
in a weeks time we're going to america
there are a lot of seats over there
many telescopes were pointed at it
the biological threat was contained
what's in that desk
the teller didn't have enough change
we therefore oppose the resolution
that's all mark ever talks about
you sure nothing's missing
we went to the zoo to see the zebras
there was no respite to be had

what do you know about miranda
grandpa hasn't called me for days
you'd better start right now
and what is that
why couldn't you just look at his feet
it's like a plague
they know it was an accident
let them come in
break this crowd up
you got plenty of money
shall i announce you
how about once more around the park
all the words you've got
dont you like it
i'm going out with her toning
i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
make hay while the sun shines
nothing to be seen
i'm feeling too good
a dog running on grass
come out of there
a small boy swimming underwater
what were you doing in boston
tell them mrs craig is here
and he gave the boy his blessing
a man standing alone in a park
i think perhaps i'd better go to bed
i think perhaps i'd better go to bed
and when they do i get mad
and he vanished around the corner of the plaza

the bottom view of a bridge
he just got a new kite for his birthday
mia turned seven today

there'll be no red uprising
all i say is spit them out
they have searched it thoroughly
i prefer pizza with thin crust
the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
why didn't you call me
i had no idea
the secret is here in the present
maybe she didn't even remember him
the caravan moved toward the east
i'll always let you down
a new movie is shown the first time in cinema
you can't see mr dan
the toilet needed cleaning
don't be a pessimist
the boy laughed  out of happiness
haven't you got a bullet i can bite
where'd you get that belt
oh i think you are right
what did you think of that trip
i get more of a kick out of it that way
you can't believe it's not butter

the city was still sleeping
i don't care whether she did or not
he wasn't an alchemist

tenderly tenor
a small dog runs to catch a ball
